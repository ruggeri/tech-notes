* Finish Grover's algo.
* PCA/SVD work.
* Kalman Filtering. SLAM.
* Writeup how reverse image search works. Text search/info retrieval.
* Zero knowledge proof. Interactive proofs? Zcash?
* Slasher protocol.
* Compiler project.
* Might be nice to get Deep Q Network to actually work...
  * Neural Turing Machine, Monte-Carlo Tree Search.

I think I want to resume studying AI/ML maybe. SVD and Kalman
filtering are techniques I still want to properly understand.

There isn't much I'm interested in with regard to algorithms. I am
still interested in recalling how things like reverse image search and
text search work.

I don't think there is anything I really care to learn about
databases. With regard to distributed systems, I am interested in how
something like Zcash works (more about crypto than distributed). I
might also want to review Slasher again?
