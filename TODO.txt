**AI/ML**

* Read Probabilistic Robotics.
* Decision trees, random forests, boosting, bagging.
* Understand SVM better.
* Maybe review Norvig AI textbook for ideas.
* Resume Driverless Car? CS188 style course?
* Kalman filtering

**Distributed Systems**

* Now that I've read Spanner/F1, I'm done for now.

**Math**

* Understand PCA/SVD properly.
* *Fast* Fourier Transform.
* Differential Equations

**Other**

* Grover's Algorithm
* Read Taming Text. (or maybe that distributed systems book or the
  elastic search one or some other info retrieval book)
* Learn Electronics properly.
* Learn Physics properly.
* Coq

**Not Essential**

* Memory fencing: I don't understand this.

**General Interests**

* Machine learning on the backburner again maybe.
  * Except maybe I should think broadly about ways to make ML fun for
    me?
  * But fundamentally how would I test out those possibilities?
* Theorem proving. GOFAI techniques in limited domains where success
  is possible. Games, planning, theorem proving.
* Database implementation.
* Formal verification.
* Programming language implementation (a little bit).
* Information retrieval and search.
