* Physics:
  * I think I want to learn all intro physics.
  * Especially electronics!
  * Feynman lectures?
* Zero knowledge proof. Interactive proofs? Zcash?
  * Is there a book that covers this?
* Return to notes on Prisoner's Dilemma from computability standpoint?
  * What Prisoner's Dilemma books exist?
* Writeup how reverse image search works. Text search/info retrieval.
* Compiler project.
* Might be nice to get Deep Q Network to actually work...
  * Alpha Go.
  * Neural Turing Machine, Monte-Carlo Tree Search.
  * Attention.
  * GPT-2 type stuff?
  * That cooperation paper.
* JRN mentioned quintic insolvability.
* Wavelet transform?
* ODEs came up in describing spring harmonic motion.

* Are there any *skills* that I want to build up? Like, say, carpentry.

There isn't much I'm interested in with regard to algorithms. I am
still interested in recalling how things like reverse image search and
text search work.

I don't think there is anything more that I really care to learn about
databases. With regard to distributed systems, I am interested in how
something like Zcash works (more about crypto than distributed). I
think I have satiated my curiosity about proof-of-stake like Slasher.

**Typesetting**

I want to try to writeup a lot of old math notes in Latex. Here I list
some documents to start with. Note: I may already *understand* these,
but I may still want to present them more clearly and accessibly for
others.

* Typeset SVD notes.
* Typeset notes on Lagrange constrained optimization.
* Typeset notes on Newton's method.
* Typeset notes on Fourier transform.
* Typeset notes on Quantum (Simon's and Grover's algos).
* Typeset linear algebra notes (maybe too much work...).
