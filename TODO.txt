* Kalman Filtering.
  * Normal distribution parameter estimation.
* Read Latex manual.
* Read up on Docker. Finish TypeGraphQL exploration.
* Writeup how reverse image search works. Text search/info retrieval.
* Zero knowledge proof. Interactive proofs? Zcash?
* Return to notes on Prisoner's Dilemma from computability standpoint?
* Compiler project.
* Might be nice to get Deep Q Network to actually work...
  * Neural Turing Machine, Monte-Carlo Tree Search.
* Continue DB project? Bitcoin project?

I think I want to resume studying AI/ML maybe. Now that I understand
SVD, I think understanding Kalman filtering is within my reach.

There isn't much I'm interested in with regard to algorithms. I am
still interested in recalling how things like reverse image search and
text search work.

I don't think there is anything more that I really care to learn about
databases. With regard to distributed systems, I am interested in how
something like Zcash works (more about crypto than distributed). I
think I have satiated my curiosity about proof-of-stake like Slasher.

**Typesetting**

I want to try to writeup a lot of old math notes in Latex. Here I list
some documents to start with. Note: I may already *understand* these,
but I may still want to present them more clearly and accessibly for
others.

* Typeset SVD notes.
* Typeset notes on Lagrange constrained optimization.
* Typeset notes on Newton's method.
* Typeset notes on Fourier transform.
* Typeset notes on Quantum (Simon's and Grover's algos).
* Typeset notes on RSA (including Lagrange's theorem type stuff).
* Typeset linear algebra notes (maybe too much work...).
