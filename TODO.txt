## Explanation

I think I've satiated my interest in algorithms, databases, distributed
systems. Those were fun mental games/playgrounds, but I don't feel
motivated to go deeper into the minutia of them. There are a few tiny
exceptions (reverse image search, building a compiler).

I seem to be more focused on physical science (physics, electronics,
even chemistry!). I think this relates to wanting to learn how to
control/manipulate "meatspace." This is also taking me into some applied
math.

I can still be interested from time-to-time in crypto stuff. It
definitely feels "magical" that we can do certain things. And it does
feel powerful and fit in with some of my anti-corporatist sentiment.

I can always keep half an eye on ML to see if anything interesting or
exciting comes up. Since I'm not focused on ends, my interest depends
primarily on whether there are fundamentally new and interesting
techniques.

Pure mathematics doesn't much motivate me. But for reasons of personal
history, I would enjoy revisiting quintic unsolvability!

## Typesetting

I want to try to writeup a lot of old math notes in Latex. Here I list
some documents to start with. Note: I may already *understand* these,
but I may still want to present them more clearly and accessibly for
others.

* Typeset SVD notes.
* Typeset notes on Lagrange constrained optimization.
* Typeset notes on Newton's method.
* Typeset notes on Fourier transform.
* Typeset notes on Quantum (Simon's and Grover's algos).
* Typeset linear algebra notes (maybe too much work...).
