## TODO

* As we approach the thrilling conclusion, there are a few LYAH pages:
  * http://learnyouahaskell.com/for-a-few-monads-more
    * Have read until 'Some useful monadic functions'
  * http://learnyouahaskell.com/zippers
* After reading these pages, I should probably do a thorough
  investigation into `GHC.Base` and `Control.Monad` to review the
  various functions that are defined therein.
* Years ago, I claimed that I saw (and wrote) the `State` monad. If
  that's true, could I explain it here today?
