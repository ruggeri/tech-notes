# TODOs

* As we approach the thrilling conclusion, there are a few LYAH pages:
  * http://learnyouahaskell.com/for-a-few-monads-more
    * Have read until 'Some useful monadic functions'
  * http://learnyouahaskell.com/zippers
* Want to understand what `<*>` means for `Writer` and `State`.
* Read about monad transformers
  * This is heavily used for `Writer` and `State`. I want to know what
    it is about.
* I've also heard talk about `Arrow`. What is that?
* I may want to browse the Haskell source code more:
  * Might peak around `GHC.Base` for more info.
  * I think there's more functionality in `Control.Monad`.
* Random:
  * What is `MonadFail`, `MonadTrans`, `MonadIO`?
  * What is `callCC`.
