Java adds features very slow. The last big set of features was
in 2004. Java 6 (2006) added no language changes; Java 7 (2011) added
generic type inferene; and Java 8 (2015) is the most significant
release in 11 years, adding just lambdas and default methods.

This is striking relative to C++. But I guess Java benefited from
C++'s learnings from the beginning.

* Java 1 (1996)
    * Prehistory.
* Java 2 (1998)
    * In 1999 gained HotSpot.
* Java 3 (2000)
    * First release that started with HotSpot.
* Java 4 (2002)
    * Exception chaining.
* Java 5 (2004)
    * Generics
    * Annotations
    * Autoboxing
    * enums
    * `for (Item item : items)` added
* Java 6 (2006)
    * This was the Java I lived with at QC.
    * Looks like several improvements to HotSpot happened in this
      version.
    * Added incremental GC. Tiered compilation.
* Java 7 (2011)
    * `invokedynamic`
        * For dynamic languages; I don't want to get into it.
    * Can write `List<>` to do some type inference.
        * `Map<X, Y> myMap = new Map<>();`
* Java 8 (2015)
    * Lambdas
        * `() -> { doStuff }`.
        * `(int x) -> x + 1`
        * Can sometimes leave out types if they can be inferred:
          `BinaryIntOp f = (x, y) -> x + y`
        * Just a shorthand way of defining a class implementing an
          `operation` method.
        * It looks like you can use a lambda anywhere an interface
          with a single abstract method is required. That adds
          flexibility.
        * Can close over variables, but they need to be never
          modified. They're going to be copied. But of course, they
          can experience mutations.
    * Default Methods
        * Interfaces can provide a default implementation of a
          method. But still no data.
        * Problem would be if two interfaces had different
          implementations of same method signature. That would cause
          an error.
        * I guess this makes them more like mixins.
* And many more. Up to Java 14 today?

## Java Ecosystem

The OpenJDK project develops the primary Java
implementation. Officially supported releases are called Java
SE. These are based on OpenJDK and released by Oracle (used to be by
Sun).

Apparently Oracle no longer releases security updates for older
versions of Java under a permissive license. Thus there exists
AdoptOpenJDK which is a project that maintains older versions of Java.
