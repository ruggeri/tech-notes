Phone operating systems don't typically give you unrestricted access
to do whatever you want.

In the Android world, which runs a *nix like system, you can *root*
the phone, which means you gain root user privileges. I did this on my
Pixel 2 by unlocking the bootloader and loading TWRP.

*Unlocking* the bootloader allows you to boot operating systems not
signed by the manufacturer. Most Android phones don't let you do this;
Pixel 2 makes it very easy.

After booting into TWRP, you can flash the recovery image with a
patched version of the OS. You then recover the patched version. The
patched OS is specific to the phone.

Note: you don't need to root to install apps distributed outside the
App Store. This can always be done by *sideloading*.

However, you need root to have root access and modify the system.

I'm not sure how Magisk fits into this. I think that maybe it is an
app that manages being able to enable root. I think the TWRP images
maybe have something to do with "magiskboot".

LineageOS is the community continuation of the CyanogenMod
project. They didn't have a build for Pixel 2 when I got mine. It is
like a distro of Linux.

**I have probably messed up many important details**
