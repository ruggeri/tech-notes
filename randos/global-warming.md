- ~15% world CO2 is global road transport
- ~3% world CO2 is aviation
- ~3% world CO2 is shipping
- ~3% world CO2 is construction equipment
- ~20-25% Heavy industry
  - About 33/33/33 for steel, cement, and chemicals/refining
  - Most of this is process emissions, not just fuel consumption.
- ~10% world CO2 home heating
- ~3% world CO2 agriculture. But also produces a lot of N2O!
- ~40% world CO2 electricity generation
  - We can see this is still a big problem because China continues to
    increase coal power generation TWh (not just capacity to even out
    supply). Hydro hasn't grown because China exploited best sites. Wind
    (2x) and solar (3x) increasing quickly over last 5yrs, but from low
    baseline. Did go from 10% to almost 20% of power generation. Nuclear
    increasing slowly, not really growing in energy mix. Kind of
    surprising, but nuclear is very expensive, and can't really be built
    at provincial level, instead needs national direction.
  - ChatGPT predicts that Chinese coal utilization will drop from
    6,300TWh today (60%) to 3,000TWh in 2035-2040. Maybe 4,000TWh solar
    (today 840TWh 8% in 2024), 4,000TWh wind (today 1,000TWh 10% in
    2024). It predicts 1,100TWh from nuclear (451TWh 5% today in 2024).
    Presumably hydro stays about the same 1,400TWh (14%). Basically a
    50% reduction in fossil fuel TWh.
  - United States mix:
    - Natural gas: 40%, 1800TWh. Maybe 30% and 1,500TWh.
    - Coal: 15%, 700TWh. Rapid decline to 5% and 350TWh.
    - Nuclear: 20%, 800TWh. Stable at 15% and 800TWh.
    - Wind: 10%, 500TWh. By 2040 maybe 20% 1,000TWh.
    - Hydro: 6%, 300TWh. By 2040 stays 6% 300TWh.
    - Solar: 6%, 250TWh. By 2040 maybe 25% 1,250TWh.
    - Basically, a 25% reduction in fossil fuel TWh.
    - US relies on gas because (1) it already invested a lot in plants,
      a sunk cost, (2) easier to balance gas during heat waves, cold
      snaps, (3) don't need long distance HVDC. You could keep plants
      and not run them, but US doesn't pay operators for capacity, just
      generation.
- 80-90% of new power investment is renewable. West and China are both
  at or near peak CO2 emissions. Developing world likely to skip fossil
  intense power generation. Electric car rollout underway.
  - Greater than 3degC of warming seems unlikely. But 2-2.4degC of
    warming in next 100yrs is very likely, of which 1.3degC has already
    occurred.

## Other GHGs

- CO2: from fuels and industrial processes. 65-70% share of observed
  global warming.
- N2O lives about 100yrs, vs centuries for CO2. But it has like 300x GWP
  over 100yrs vs CO2. From fertilizers.
  - Share of warming is 7%
- Fluorinated Gasses last decades to thousands of years.
  - Hard to replace as refrigerants. But emissions are small.
  - Share of warming is 3%
- Methane
  - Only 12yrs lifespan. But a 80x worse than CO2 in that span.
  - 35-40% from oil/gas leaks, coal mining. 40% from agriculture
    (ruminants and rice paddies).
  - Share of warming is 25-30%
  - Looks significant, but will drop as CO2 accumulates. Unless methane
    emissions grow faster than CO2 emissions.
