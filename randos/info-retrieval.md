* [Modern Information Retrieval](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321416910)
    * One of the most recommended. From 2011.
    * Contents: http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hearst/irbook/
    * Seems very weak on distributed in particular.
* [Introduction to Information Retrieval](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0521865719)
    * From 2008. Free on Stanford website: https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/
    * Not very much about indexing or distributed indexing IIRC.
    * Believe I already looked at this to learn more about postings
      lists.
* [Information Retrieval: Implementing and Evaluating Search Engines](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0262528878)
    * 2016. Seems promising.
    * [Contents](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/9780262026512_ind_0001.pdf)
    * Deifnitely worth looking at.
* [Search Engines: Information Retrieval in Practice](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0136072240)
    * 2008. Seems old; not sure how promising I feel this would be.
* [Information Retrieval: Algorithms and Heuristics](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1402030045)
    * 2004. Title seems promising but Springer books are random and
      this is very old.
* [Text Data Management and Analysis: A Practical Introduction to Information Retrieval and Text Mining](https://www.amazon.com/dp/197000116X)
    * 2016. Wildcard.
    * [Contents](http://www.morganclaypoolpublishers.com/catalog_Orig/samples/9781970001174_sample.pdf)
    * Basically nothing at all about indexing. Garbage.
