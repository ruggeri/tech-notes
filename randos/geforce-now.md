Basically, GeForce Now is a cloud computing service. I believe it runs
Windows, and it has some graphics hardware attached.

It streams the game to you. You interact through basically a dumb
client.

Thus, you can play games that aren't available for your operating system
(or even hardware architecture). This is a big deal for me, as a Mac
user.

The GeForce Now app on your machine is linked with your Steam account.
You have to buy the game on Steam. You can buy a game on Steam for
Windows even if you are using MacOS. In fact, when you buy a game on
Steam, you are allowed to install it via Steam on any architecture.

When you play a game on GeForce Now, it will tunnel to the GFN server.
There, it will launch your steam account. This will then automatically
launch the game.

Your ability to use the GFN machine is limited. You don't have shell.
You don't even really have easy access to Steam; the selected game is
auto-launched for you.

I believe the reason why is that some publishers object to GFN running
their games. I don't know if they could beat GFN in a lawsuit about you
playing a game you bought from them. Maybe there's some shrinkwrap
license on games that says you won't use it in the cloud? I don't know.

Anyway, GFN will not let you just launch any old game. You can only play
games from publishers they have made deals with.

As a last note: there are some alternative platforms to Steam, which are
also supported by GFN. These include Epic Games, Ubisoft, and Electronic
Arts.
