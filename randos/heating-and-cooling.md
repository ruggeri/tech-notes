# Refrigeration Cycle

- You have a closed loop.
- Evaporator interface is connected via a compressor to the condenser
  interface. The condenser is connected via an expansion valve to the
  evaporator.
  - Evaporator and condenser are basically just large surface area
    coils.
- Because a gas cools as it expands, the evaporator side will be cold.
- Conversely, upon compression, the gas will be hotter. Thus the
  condenser will be hot.
- You blow fans over evaporator/condenser to spread heat/coldness to the
  outside space. If, for instance, no air is blown over the condenser,
  then the refrigerant gas will be returned to the evaporator at the
  same temperature as it left.
- Necessarily, work needs to be performed to do the compression. There
  are necessarily energy losses.

# Implementations

- Air conditioners work on the refrigeration cycle. So do refrigerators.
- A heat pump works the same way, but is basically installed in reverse.
  It transfers heat from the outside into the house.

# Heat Pumps

- The coefficient of performance is how much heat is transferred per
  unit of energy spent running the device.
- Resistive heating by definition has a coefficient of performance of
  (practically) 1.0: all energy is being dumped as heat into the home.
- Heat pumps can increase this number, in that they are transferring
  heat from one side of the pump to the other. They don't need to
  literally create the heat.
- However, note that the heat pump efficiency will drop as the outside
  becomes colder, and it becomes harder to extract heat from the
  outside. This has been a historical problem of heat pumps.
- Additionally, note that electricity generation is not super efficient.
  If you are burning gas to generate electricity, it might be better to
  simply have a gas fired furnace in the home.
- With regard to global warming: the situation is similar to electric
  vehicle technology. But heat pumps could in principle be powered by
  clean energy.
- Some people do note that refrigerant is a super greenhouse gas. And
  any refrigeration system will inevitably have leaks.
- Another problem is that heat pumps will go off when electricity shuts
  off, whereas a gas furnace will keep running.
- Thus heat pumps make more sense in milder climates. But there are also
  _ground source_ heat pumps, which interface not with the atmosphere,
  but with the ground. The ground temperature is more stable than the
  air temperature.

# Water Heating

- Storage water heaters heat water and store it in a hot water tank.
- Typically water is brought to a high temperature, and then it sits in
  the tank.
- However, there is leakage of heat from the tank. Then you need to
  reheat the water.
- One advantage is that energy can be used at a relatively slow rate to
  heat the water. It need not instantly heat it.
- Of course, if the tank is depleted from use, there is no hot water
  left.
- Tankless heaters instantly heat water as it flows through. They do not
  retain any heated water except what is in contact with the heat
  exchanger.
  - They have unlimited flow of hot water.
  - They might use less power in that they aren't keeping a tank of
    water constantly hot.
  - It appears common for tankless heaters to be run on gas as well.
- How you generate hot water varies.
  - Traditionally, gas is burned. But you can also use electric, or even
    heat pumps.
  - You can in theory consume electricity to do the heating at times
    when the electric grid load is low. In this way, hot water tanks are
    akin to batteries.
- With tankless, you do have a short delay between turning on and
  getting hot water.
  - I think this is maybe not true with tank designs, because the lines
    to the faucets are constantly hot?
- I think people say that tankless needs maintenance maybe because the
  heat exchanger can corrode?
- People like the tankless design better for shorter lines, or even at
  the point of use.
  - But if we're talking electric, you have the same gas/electric
    tradeoff.
  - If it's central, then you have the problem where water can take a
    long time to get hot.
- It sounds like people say that if a home is in constant use, water
  tank makes more sense.
  - Though they do say that tankless can make sense if you are often
    running out of hot water from multiple serial showers (like in a
    large family).
- People say installing electric tankless means higher amperage circuits
  which means you need to do expensive electrical work.
