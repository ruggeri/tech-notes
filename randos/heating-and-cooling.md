# Refrigeration Cycle

- You have a closed loop.
- Evaporator interface is connected via a compressor to the condenser
  interface. The condenser is connected via an expansion valve to the
  evaporator.
  - Evaporator and condenser are basically just large surface area
    coils.
- Because a gas cools as it expands, the evaporator side will be cold.
- Conversely, upon compression, the gas will be hotter. Thus the
  condenser will be hot.
- You blow fans over evaporator/condenser to spread heat/coldness to the
  outside space. If, for instance, no air is blown over the condenser,
  then the refrigerant gas will be returned to the evaporator at the
  same temperature as it left.
- Necessarily, work needs to be performed to do the compression. There
  are necessarily energy losses.

# Implementations

- Air conditioners work on the refrigeration cycle. So do refrigerators.
- A heat pump works the same way, but is basically installed in reverse.
  It transfers heat from the outside into the house.

# Heat Pumps

- The coefficient of performance is how much heat is transferred per
  unit of energy spent running the device.
- Resistive heating by definition has a coefficient of performance of
  (practically) 1.0: all energy is being dumped as heat into the home.
- Heat pumps can increase this number, in that they are transferring
  heat from one side of the pump to the other. They don't need to
  literally create the heat.
- However, note that the heat pump efficiency will drop as the outside
  becomes colder, and it becomes harder to extract heat from the
  outside. This has been a historical problem of heat pumps.
- Additionally, note that electricity generation is not super efficient.
  If you are burning gas to generate electricity, it might be better to
  simply have a gas fired furnace in the home.
- With regard to global warming: the situation is similar to electric
  vehicle technology. But heat pumps could in principle be powered by
  clean energy.
- Some people do note that refrigerant is a super greenhouse gas. And
  any refrigeration system will inevitably have leaks.
- Another problem is that heat pumps will go off when electricity shuts
  off, whereas a gas furnace will keep running.
- Thus heat pumps make more sense in milder climates. But there are also
  _ground source_ heat pumps, which interface not with the atmosphere,
  but with the ground. The ground temperature is more stable than the
  air temperature.

# Water Heating

- A traditional way of heating water is to burn gas, heat water, and
  store it in a large tank for later use.
  - Alternatively, you can use resistance heating or heat pumps.
- This means you have a limited quantity of hot water. But you can use
  it at a high rate until depletion.
- Tankless heaters use either gas or electric to instantly heat water
  with a heat exchanger.
  - Because they must heat rapidly, their instantaneous gas/electric
    draw can be high.
  - For electric, you may need to add additional amperage capacity,
    which can be very expensive!
- Tankless heaters can continuously provide hot water, but they have a
  limited gallons per minute flow (based on the size of the heat
  exchanger).
  - Basically, tank is better for concurrent hot water usage. Tankless
    is better for serial usage.
- Tankless can be more energy efficient because it doesn't need to
  constantly keep the water in the tank hot. Tank systems will lose
  heat and waste energy.
  - On the other hand, tankless must provide high heat instantly.
    Whereas tanks can heat the tank more slowly, or even at off-peak
    times.
  - Still, tankless has efficiency that is at least 80%, rather than at
    most 60% for tanks.
- Tankless needs (basic) maintenance to avoid fouling of the heat
  exchanger.
- Tankless can have a short delay between turning on and getting hot
  water.
  - With tank designs, the lines to the faucets are typically at least
    warm, from expansion from the hot water heater.
  - You could see this as waste, or as readily providing hot water.
  - The further the faucet is from the tank in the house, the longer it
    takes to start getting hot water from a tank.
  - So you'll get hot water faster if the tankless heater is close to
    the point of use.
- Conclusions
  - If you have a lot of people in your household who take serial
    showers, tankless might make sense.
  - If you have long periods of no-use, then tankless might make sense.
  - Tankless may make more sense if it can be closer to point of use.

# Central Heating

- You can heat air with a furnace and blow it around the home.
  - This can be done with electric, a heat pump, or with gas.
  - With electric resistance heating, you might as well do it right at
    the location of your heat requirement?
  - The heat can turn on very fast.
- Steam heating distributes hot steam in the house. It runs through a
  radiator, loses heat to the room, and condenses as water. This flows
  back to the steam boiler.
  - No one installs steam heat anymore.
  - I think a major benefit was that you didn't need pumps.
  - It's apparently sophisticated to run the piping correctly so that
    the liquid water returns properly.
  - I think also you have the problem that when only moderate heating is
    desired, you still have to make steam, which requires a minimum
    heat level.
  - You also can't run different rooms at different heat levels.
- Electric baseboard heating just runs electricity through a resister. I
  think you get the same efficiency (but lower output) from anything you
  plug in the wall?
  - These systems work through convection: the spontaneous distribution
    of hotter fluid through a medium.
  - If the heat is not evenly distributed throughout the room, it will
    not be efficient in that the area close to the heater may get hot,
    but not impart much heat elsewhere.
  - There are baseboards that use electricity to heat water or mineral
    oil. They are supposed to be more energy efficient.
  - I think the reason is high volume and lower temperature. By having a
    consistent temperature in a large volume closer to what you want,
    you heat the air in the room more evenly?
  - In particular, I think that oil has a higher heat capacity (amount
    of energy required to change temperature by one degree). Thus a
    larger thermal mass is heated, and cannot simply blow away like the
    air in a room.
- Other hydronic systems have a central boiler and hot water is piped to
  heaters. I think this is possible nowadays with electricity so that
  you can have pumps.
  - You can run the hydronic pipes through the floor. People set the
    thermostat lower if their feet are warm.
- I saw that 1MM BTU generation using electric baseboard was $34, versus
  $14 for an electric heat pump and $7 for gas furnace.
