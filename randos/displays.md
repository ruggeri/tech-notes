## Monitor Size

The Thunderbolt Display was 27". My 2022 Dell U2723QE is 27". 27" is
about as big as my eyes can reasonably look around at on a desk. Even
then, I find myself centering VSCode or Firefox at the middle of the 27"
screen area.

A larger monitor, it feels to me, would just waste space. I wouldn't use
the edges of the monitor, I think. Even if I started to want to do a
two-column layout (say editor and compiler), looking at the edges of a
32" monitor would involve looking at an angle, rather than head-on at
the center of the screen.

## Resolution

- 1280x720: called 720p or HD
  - 16:9
- 1920x1080: called 1080p or FHD (Full HD)
  - 16:9
- 2560x1440: called 1440p or QHD (Quad HD) or WQHD (Wide Quad HD)
  - 16:9
  - Notice this quadruples the size of HD.
  - It's not any "wider" than the other 16:9 HD formats. So this is not
    very logical.
  - This was the resolution of the 27" Thunderbolt Display. Also the
    resolution of my Dell U2715H that I used at AA from mid-2015.
  - A 27" QHD screen would only reach "retina" pixel density at 34".
    Indeed, I could see the pixels of the Thunderbolt Display easily.
- 2880x1800
  - 16:10
  - This is the resolution of my 2018 MacBook Pro 15" (and also the
    prior MacBook Pro 15" I bought via App Academy).
  - For 15" display: 221px/in, 87px/cm, 77px/degree (at 20" typical
    distance).
  - Apple gives this resolution/size "Retina" approval.
- 3072x1920
  - 16:10
  - This is the resolution of my 2019 MacBook Pro 16".
  - For 16" display: 226px/in, 89px/cm, 79px/degree (at 20" typical
    distance).
  - Apple gives this resolution/size "Retina" approval.
- 3840x2160: called UHD (Ultra HD), 4k, and rarely called 2160p
  - This is the native resolution of my new Dell U2723QE monitor.
  - In cinema, 4k means 4096x2160 (called DCI 4k). In computing, 4k UHD
    is 3840x2160.
  - At 27", this is 163px/inch. Retina pixel density is achieved at a
    viewing distance of 21" (calculated from a website calculator). So
    this is more-or-less retina density to me (I'm about 20-24" from my
    computer screen at my desk).
  - I appear to be perfectly happy with my Dell U2723QE 27" UHD
    resolution and pixel density.
- 5120x2880: 5K
  - 16:9
  - Apple recommends this for 27" screen size. They sell a 5K, 27" LG
    UltraFine through their store ($1300).
  - This have 77% higher pixel density from same-size UHD screen.
- 6016x3384: 6K
  - 16:9
  - Apple recommends this at 32". They sell the 32" Pro Display XDR at
    6K for $5k. And then you have to buy a $1k stand!

## Refresh Rate

- My Dell U2723QE and Apple Thunderbolt displays both ran at 60Hz.
- When misconfigured, I've experienced 30Hz and it feels quite laggy and
  unresponsive.
- I don't have experience with higher refresh rates, but I'm not sure
  they would really be useful.

## Monitor Features

- Matte display
  - The Thunderbolt Display had a glossy display and I really didn't
    like it.
  - The Dell UltraSharp line has a very nice matte screen.
  - I suspect that matte is more important than higher resolution to me.
    It just feels easier on the eyes.
- Solid and _adjustable_ stand
  - The Thunderbolt Display had to be fucking propped up on books which
    is stupid. This is bad ergonomically and for my back.
  - The Dell UltraSharp has solid adjustability.
- Minimal bezel
  - I didn't hate the Thunderbolt Display large bezel. But it wasn't a
    plus.
  - But I do have a preference for the UltraSharp's more subtle bezel.
  - The UltraSharp does still have a bezel. But it is subtle, and mostly
    level with the display screen. It's very unobtrusive to me.
- I want USB-C charging of my laptop.
  - I want to plug my laptop in with a single, simple cable.
- I want to run the video over USB-C.
  - This can happen with via USB-C Alternate Mode (like my Dell
    U2723QE).
  - It can also work via Thunderbolt 3/4 or USB4. These allow for a
    tunneled DisplayPort protocol to be sent to the display.
- I want enough bandwidth over USB-C to run high-speed USB peripherals.
  - This is a nice-to-have in case I want to plug an external drive into
    my monitor.
  - USB-C 3.2 doesn't have enough bandwidth to support UHD @ 60Hz _and_
    speeds above USB 2.0 (woeful).
    - Well, see my discussion of USB Alternate Mode for more info.
    - In short: DisplayPort 1.2 can't do this. DisplayPort 1.4 can if
      you can enable DSC compression. DisplayPort 2.0 might be able to
      do this without DSC.
  - That implies you want to use Thunderbolt 3/4 or USB 4. These can do
    enough bandwidth to run UHD @ 60Hz _and_ high speed USB peripherals.
  - I am making do fine with low speed USB with the Dell U2723QE. But it
    bugs me to have low USB speed on a brand-new monitor.
- I like having an integrated ethernet port.
  - This helps with internet reliability. And again, I don't want to
    plug more than one cable into my laptop.
- Ports
  - It's nice to have a number of USB A receptacles. I currently use 3
    (keyboard, mouse, webcam). (U2723QE has 5 USB-A receptacles).
    - I need fewer now that I use my power strip to charge accessories
      on the floor. It's nicer that way because fewer cords on my desk.
  - I need few USB-C ports because I can always plug into the MacBook
    Pro. U2723QE has 1 USB-C downstream receptacle.
  - HDMI and DisplayPort are no longer necessary because I will just use
    USB-C connection.
  - I don't think I really care about daisy-chaining monitors.

## Recommendations

I haven't been let down by the Dell UltraSharp series. They're clean and
functional, have connectivity, ethernet, good resolution, pixel density,
great matting, great stability. If/when they add USB4 or Thunderbolt 3/4
support, then they really will be exceptional.

Apple's approved LG UltraFine 5K would not work for me. It's expensive,
and it only has USB-C connectivity, and no ethernet port.

The Apple XDR display is way too expensive for me.
