\section{No Cloning}

\begin{remark}
  Basically, there is no unitary transformation which maps
  $\braket{\psi} \otimes \braket{0} \mapsto \braket{\psi} \otimes
  \braket{\psi}$. Which means you can't clone a quantum state (unless
  you already know what the state is).

  This means that quantum state is, in a sense, truly ``private.'' If we
  could clone $\braket{\psi}$, we could clone it a lot, and keep trying
  to measure in the computational basis. That would tell us the squares
  of the probability amplitude.

  We could then keep doing that in the Hadamard basis, to gain the phase
  information. If we kept at it, we could figure out what $\psi$ is
  through statistical testing. That's what no cloning says we
  \emph{can't} do. We can't clone, so we can't run these tests.

  Aaronson suggests that quantum state is private in a similar sense to
  the ``bias'' on a coin you get to flip exactly once.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  What is the proof of the no cloning theorem? It is that an operation
  which clones would destroy the information in the second bit, which
  means the operation cannot be unitary. Since our model restricts us to
  unitary operations, our model forbids cloning.
\end{remark}
