\section{No Cloning}

Basically, there is no unitary transformation which maps `|psi>
\otimes |0>` to `|psi> \otimes |psi>`. Which means you can't clone
a quantum state (unless you already know what the state is).

This means that quantum state is, in a sense, truly "private." If we
could clone psi, we could clone it a lot, and keep trying to measure
in the computational basis. That would tell us the squares of the
probability amplitude.

We could then keep doing that in the Hadamard basis, to gain more
information. If we keep at it, we can figure out what psi is through
statistical testing.

That's what no cloning says we *can't* do. We can't clone, so we can't
run these tests.

Aaronson suggests that this is like trying to figure out the fairness
of a coin based on one coin flip.
