* Scott Aaronson
  * Now I get it!
* Quantum Computing Without the Physics (Italian TJ Watson guy).
  * Super helpful!
* https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/4430/quantum-teleportation-second-classical-bit-for-removing-entanglement
  * This helped me understand *a lot*.
* The geometry section on Wikipedia for Grover's algo was actually quite
