\section{Quantum Teleportation}

\begin{remark}
  Say I want to communicate my qubit $q$ with you, but I don't have a
  quantum channel to you. I do have a classical channel on which I can
  sends ones and zeroes.

  If my qubit $q$ were in a basis state, everything would be easy (I'd
  just send a one or two). But the point is that it might not be. It
  might even be in a state I don't know!

  If we share an EPR pair already, here's what we can do. First, let the
  quantum state be notated:

  \begin{nedqn}
    \parens{
      \alpha \zket + \beta \oket
    }
    \otimes
    \sqtot
    \parens{
      \zzket + \ooket
    }
  \end{nedqn}

  \noindent
  (The first qubit is the one I wish to teleport, the second is my half
  of the EPR pair, and the third is your half of the EPR pair).

  First, I will apply a CX of my qubit with my half of the EPR pair.
  This gives us:

  \begin{nedqn}
    \sqtot
    \parens{
      \alpha \zzzket
      + \alpha \zooket
      + \beta \oozket
      + \beta \ozoket
    }
  \end{nedqn}

  \noindent
  Now imagine I measure \emph{my} half of the EPR pair. If I measure
  zero, then the reduced state is:

  \begin{nedqn}
    \alpha \braket{000} + \beta \braket{101}
  \end{nedqn}

  \noindent
  Now, if my friend measures their third qubit, they will get a zero/one
  result with the correct probabilities $\norm{\alpha}, \norm{\beta}$.
  However, they have not truly been sent my qubit. The reason is that
  they cannot perform quantum operations on it with the expected result.

  For instance: say I produced $\alpha \zket + \beta \oket$ by Hadamard
  operation on $\zket$. That is, $\alpha = \beta = \sqtot$. Then, I
  claim that after teleportation, I should be able to tell my friend to
  apply $\mtxH$ to recover $\zket$.

  But this won't work for them. The problem is the first qubit of state
  that \emph{I} hold onto. I have entangled the first qubit with the
  third. So when my friend applies $\mtxH$ to their third qubit, they
  are performing:

  \begin{nedqn}
    \parens{\mtxI \otimes \mtxI \otimes \mtxH}
    \parens{\sqtot \zzzket + \sqtot \ozoket}
  \eqcol
    \parens{
      \sqtot \zzket
      \otimes
      \mtxH \zket
    }
    +
    \parens{
      \sqtot \ozket
      \otimes
      \mtxH \oket
    }
  \\
  \eqcol
    \half
    \parens{\zzzket + \zzoket}
    +
    \half
    \parens{\ozzket - \ozoket}
  \end{nedqn}

  \noindent
  If only the states $\zzzket, \ozzket$ could \emph{constructively}
  interfere! If only the states $\zzoket, \ozoket$ could
  \emph{destructively} interfere!
\end{remark}

% Let me instead apply H to the qubit I'm trying to send. We then get:

%     (1/sqrt(2))
%     \alpha ((1/sqrt(2)) (|000> + |100>))
%     + \alpha ((1/sqrt(2)) (|011> + |111>))
%     + \beta ((1/sqrt(2)) (|010> - |110>))
%     + \beta ((1/sqrt(2)) (|001> - |101>))

% We may rearrange:

%     1/2
%     (\alpha |000> + \beta |001>)
%     + (\beta |010> + \alpha |011>)
%     + (\alpha |100> - \beta |101>)
%     + (\beta |110> - \alpha |111>)

% Now, we measure both of our qubits. There are four cases:

% * 00 -> They have `\alpha |0> + \beta |1>`.
% * 01 -> They have `\beta |0> + \alpha |1>`. Apply Pauli X NOT.
% * 10 -> They have `\alpha |0> - \beta |1>`. Apply Pauli Z phase shift.
% * 11 -> They have `\beta |0> - \alpha |1>`. Apply Pauli X NOT, then
%   Pauli Z phase shift.

% Note: there is no faster-than-light communication, because we need to
% send the bits. Second: there is no cloning because we have destroyed our
% copy of the EPR pair.
