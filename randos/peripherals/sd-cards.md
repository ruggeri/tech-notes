- MicroSD is the format size that is used for cellphones or the GoPro.
  They are physically very small; about the size of a finger nail.
- SD cards are about double the physical size.
- They come in various _capacities_:
  - SDSC (standard capacity) can do up to 2GB.
  - SDHC (high capacity) can do up to 32GB.
  - SDXC (eXtended capacity) can do up to 2TB.
  - SDUC (ultra capacity) can do up to 128TB (I've never seen this).
  - For any of these standards, you can have Micro or regular size
    versions.
  - I believe that otherwise there is no physical distinction between
    these capacity types?
- Speed
  - There is also the question of transfer speed.
  - Default speed is 12.5MBps.
  - UHS-I can do 104MBps.
  - UHS-II can do 312MBps.
  - UHS-III can do 624MBps.
  - SD Express can do gigabyte and above speeds.
- Speed Class
  - This is weird. I guess the UHS-I, II, III refer to bus speed. That
    isn't necessarily the speed that data can be written or read, which
    is not symmetric normally anyway.
  - Thus, there are UHS speed levels. U1 requires at least 10MBps write
    speed, while U3 requires at least 30MBps write speed.
  - There are also _video speed classes_. V90 requires at least 90MBps
    write speed.
  - These classes are basically a non-numeric, simplified way to
    indicate the capabilities of a card.
- Typical markings
  - I have a Lexar card.
  - It says 128GB capacity.
  - It is marked SDXC, which corresponds to size format and capacity.
  - It says 300MB/s, which is a reference to bus speed.
  - Likewise, it is marked UHS-II. This is listed simply as roman
    numerals.
  - It is marked U3, which means it does 30MBps+ write. This is listed
    as the numeral 3 in a U (looks like in a garbage can).
  - It is further marked V90, which means it does 90MBps+ write. This is
    a V followed by the number 90.
