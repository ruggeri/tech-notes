## Monitor Size

My Thunderbolt Display (released 2011) was 27". My 2022 Dell U2723QE is
27". I purchased it in 2022-02-XX. 27" is about as big as my eyes can
reasonably look around at on a desk. Even then, I find myself centering
VSCode or Firefox at the middle of the 27" screen area.

A larger monitor, it feels to me, would just waste space. I wouldn't use
the edges of the monitor, I think. Even if I started to want to do a
two-column layout (say editor and compiler), looking at the edges of a
32" monitor would involve looking at an angle, rather than head-on at
the center of the screen.

## Resolution

- **1280x720**: called 720p or HD.
  - 16:9
  - 0.92MP.
- 1366x768: WXGA.
  - Approx 16:9.
  - I believe this was common transitional format as computer displays
    shifted from 4:3 to 16:9.
  - I had this on my 2012 11" MacBook Air.
  - 1.05MP.
- 1440x900. WXGA+.
  - 16:10.
  - A common format for laptop screens c2010.
  - 1.3MP.
- **1920x1080**: called 1080p or FHD (Full HD)
  - 16:9
  - This is sometimes called 2k (the horizontal resolution), though DCI
    2k is technically a little wider (2048x1080). This allows easily
    showing 1.85:1 (open matte) or 2.39:1 (Scope) films. Both formats
    are wider than 16:9 (which is really more of a display format).
  - This is the resolution of my digital BenQ projector purchased 2014.
  - 2.1MP
- **2560x1440**: called 1440p or QHD (Quad HD) or WQHD (Wide Quad HD)
  - 16:9
  - Notice this quadruples the size of HD.
  - It's not any "wider" than the other 16:9 HD formats. So this is not
    very logical.
  - This was the resolution of the 27" Thunderbolt Display. Also the
    resolution of my Dell U2715H that I used at AA from mid-2015.
  - A 27" QHD screen would only reach "retina" pixel density at 34".
    Indeed, I could see the pixels of the Thunderbolt Display easily. I
    no longer consider this acceptable image quality.
  - This has a 109 PPI and a 49 PPD at 24" (40 at 20"). That is
    significantly lower than the UHD 27" monitor or the MBP Retina
    display.
  - 3.7MP
- 2880x1800. QWXGA+.
  - 16:10
  - Quadruples WXGA+ to support "Retina."
  - This is the resolution of my 2018 MacBook Pro 15" (the one that was
    stolen) and also the prior MacBook Pro 15" I bought via App
    Academy.
  - For 15" display: 221px/in, 87px/cm, 77px/degree (at 20" typical
    distance).
  - Apple gives this resolution/size "Retina" approval.
  - 5.2MP
- 3072x1920
  - 16:10
  - This is the resolution of my 2019 MacBook Pro 16" (which I use as of
    2025-02-XX).
  - For 16" display: 226px/in, 89px/cm, 79px/degree (at 20" typical
    distance).
  - Notice that the 16" MBP screen is bigger than the 15", but pixel
    density stayed the same.
  - Apple gives this resolution/size "Retina" approval.
  - This resolution has no standardized name...
  - 5.9MP
- 3456x2234
  - 1.55:1 (a little taller than 16:10)
  - This is the resolution for the 2023 Mac Book Pro 16" (which I don't
    own as of 2025-02-XX).
  - It's a little weirdly tall.
  - 7.7MP
- **3840x2160**: called UHD (Ultra HD), 4k, and rarely called 2160p
  - 16:9
  - This is the native resolution of my current (as of 2025-03-XX) Dell
    U2723QE monitor (cost ~$850).
  - In cinema, 4k means 4096x2160 (called DCI 4k). In computing, 4k UHD
    is 3840x2160.
  - At 27", this is 163px/inch. That is substantially lower PPI than the
    2019 MBP 16" (lower resolution, but also smaller screen).
  - However, to compare screen quality, we might want to compare PPD. At
    24" viewing distance, a 27" UHD monitor has a 74 PPD. That is
    comparable to the MBP.
  - At 20" viewing distance, this drops to 63 PPD.
  - If 57 PPD is taken as the definition of retina, then the monitor
    achieves retina quality.
  - I appear to be perfectly happy with my Dell U2723QE 27" UHD
    resolution and pixel density.
  - 8.3MP
- 5120x2880: 5K
  - 16:9
  - Apple recommends this for 27" screen size. They sell a 5K, 27" LG
    UltraFine through their store ($1300).
  - The Apple Studio Display
    (https://www.apple.com/studio-display/specs/) is $1600, 27", 5K. It
    has a built-in camera, but no built-in Ethernet. It uses Thunderbolt
    3, which is necessary to drive this device. People also say they
    like the nanotexture anti-reflective coating.
  - This have 77% higher pixel density from same-size UHD screen.
  - It has 84-98 PPD at 20-24" distance. That's about the same as the
    MBP Retina display.
  - 15MP.
- 6016x3384: 6K
  - 16:9
  - Apple recommends this at 32". They sell the 32" Pro Display XDR at
    6K for $5k. And then you have to buy a $1k stand!
  - 20MP.

## Refresh Rate

- My Dell U2723QE and Apple Thunderbolt displays both ran at 60Hz.
- When misconfigured, I've experienced 30Hz and mouse tracking feels
  unbearably laggy and unresponsive.
- I don't have experience with higher refresh rates, but I'm not sure
  they would really be useful. Many people do seek this out, but then
  they need more bandwidth on the display interconnect.

## Monitor Features

- Matte display
  - The Thunderbolt Display had a glossy display and I really didn't
    like it.
  - The Dell UltraSharp line has a very nice matte screen.
  - I suspect that matte is more important than higher resolution to me.
    It just feels easier on the eyes.
- Solid and _adjustable_ stand
  - The Thunderbolt Display had to be fucking propped up on books which
    is stupid. This is bad ergonomically and for my back.
  - The Dell UltraSharp has solid adjustability.
- Minimal bezel
  - I didn't hate the Thunderbolt Display large bezel. But it wasn't a
    plus.
  - But I do have a preference for the UltraSharp's more subtle bezel.
  - The UltraSharp does still have a bezel. But it is subtle, and mostly
    level with the display screen. It's very unobtrusive to me.
- I want USB-C charging of my laptop.
  - I want to plug my laptop in with a single, simple cable.
- I want to run the video over USB-C.
  - This can happen with via USB-C Alternate Mode (like my Dell
    U2723QE).
  - It can also work via Thunderbolt 3/4 or USB4. These allow for a
    tunneled DisplayPort protocol to be sent to the display.
- I want enough bandwidth over USB-C to run high-speed USB peripherals.
  - This is a nice-to-have in case I want to plug an external drive into
    my monitor.
  - USB 3 Gen 2 doesn't have enough bandwidth to support UHD @ 60Hz
    _and_ speeds above USB 2.0 480Mbps.
    - Well, see my discussion of USB Alternate Mode for more info.
    - In short: DisplayPort 1.2 can't do this. DisplayPort 1.4 can if
      you can enable DSC compression. DisplayPort 2.0 might be able to
      do this without DSC. But this monitor only does DisplayPort 1.4...
    - This monitor does claim DSC support.
  - That implies you want to use Thunderbolt 3/4 or USB 4. These can do
    enough bandwidth to run UHD @ 60Hz _and_ high speed USB peripherals.
  - I am making do fine with low speed USB with the Dell U2723QE. But it
    bugs me to have low USB speed on a brand-new monitor.
    - Mar 2023 update: I think slow USB peripheral speed hasn't been a
      problem? There's only 480Mbps for keyboard, mouse, ethernet and
      webcam. But that is maybe enough??
    - 2025-03-XX Update: Looks like I have been running 4k@60hz with
      30-bit color. With "USB-C Prioritization: High Resolution", it
      says that "Stream Info: 5.4Gbps" and "USB: USB2.0". Does this
      imply HBR2 is being used? Does 2x HBR3 doesn't have the bandwidth
      to do 4k@60Hz with 30-bit color uncompressed and USB3? However, if
      I set "USB-C Prioritization: High Data Speed", it now shows
      "Resolution: 3840x2160, 60Hz, 30-bit" (4k@60Hz 30-bit), "USB:
      USB3.1", "Stream Info: 8.1Gbps DSC" (does that mean HBR3 with
      DSC?). Interesting! It looks like Apple fixed DSC. Indeed,
      switching from USB 2.0 to USB 3.2 Gen 2 speed, I go from 227Mbps
      down to 304Mbps down (up stays constant at 42Mbps). I can't see
      any change in image quality with DSC.
      - 2025-08-16: I tried to update these notes to more accurately
        record the settings on the monitor. However, at this time I
        cannot remember all the various HBR
        bandwidths/settings/capabilities/requirements. So I just updated
        and recorded the available monitor settings and tried to make
        clear my guesses about HBR are speculation. Nothing on the "Dell
        Display Info" say anything about HBR explicitly. The reason I
        revisited this at all was because the monitor slipped into 30Hz
        mode. I just restarted the MacBook and toggled between High-Data
        and High-Resolution modes.
- I like having an integrated ethernet port.
  - This helps with internet reliability. And again, I don't want to
    plug more than one cable into my laptop.
- Ports
  - It's nice to have a number of USB A receptacles. I currently use 3
    (keyboard, mouse, webcam). (U2723QE has 5 USB-A receptacles).
    - I need fewer now that I use my power strip to charge accessories
      on the floor. It's nicer that way because fewer cords on my desk.
  - I need few USB-C ports because I can always plug into the MacBook
    Pro. U2723QE has 1 USB-C downstream receptacle.
  - HDMI and DisplayPort are no longer necessary because I will just use
    USB-C connection.
  - I don't think I really care about daisy-chaining monitors. This is
    for the same reason that I don't desire a monitor larger than 27"
    anyway.

## Display Types

- Both my 2019 MacBook Pro and the Dell U2723QE use LCD displays, using
  LEDs as the backlight. Both appear to use "IPS", which is maybe the
  better of two LED backlit LCD technologies?
- Plasma screens have a downside of poor contrast, and also run hot.
  They are thicker. But they are apparently very good at showing motion.
  They are generally a previous-generation technology and are no longer
  produced.
- OLED appears to be the best technology at the moment. Not in use for
  Mac Books as of 2023, but is in use for iPhone since ~2017. Many
  people appear to think this is the best display technology in 2023.
  - It looks like 27" OLED monitors are still relatively uncommon as of
    Sept 2023. I think maybe no Dell monitor is OLED in Sept 2023.
  - I think OLED is supposed to have the highest _contrast_. This is the
    difference between dark and bright. This can give very vibrant tones
    and colors. LCD screens use a backlight which tends to reduce
    contrast.
  - Another aspect is _brightness_, measured in _nits_. OLED tends to
    perform worse than LCD in terms of total brightness. Brightness can
    matter when the room itself is not dark, so you need a brighter
    image.
  - So some people suggest OLED for darker rooms, and QLED for brighter
    rooms.
  - As a practical example, the OLED viewfinder in my A7RV looks way
    more vibrant than my Dell U2723QE LCD (not QLED) display. Might also
    be the pixel density (very high on viewfinder, but viewed very
    close...), and maybe total lack of glare (because eyecup).
- QLED is a new technology from Samsung. They improve on the LED backlit
  LCD panels. But it sounds like most people still prefer OLED for TV.
- For projectors, laser illumination seems to be preferred to bulbs.

## Recommendations

I haven't been let down by the Dell UltraSharp series. They're clean and
functional, have connectivity, ethernet, good resolution, pixel density,
great matting, great stability. If/when they add USB4 or Thunderbolt 3/4
support, then they really will be exceptional.

Apple's approved LG UltraFine 5K would not work for me. It's expensive,
and it only has USB-C connectivity, and no ethernet port.

The Apple XDR display is way too expensive for me.
