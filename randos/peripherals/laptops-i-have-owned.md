- Current upgrade (as of 2025-03-XX):
  - 2024 Mac Book Pro 16" M4 Pro 14 CPU/20 GPU
  - $2.9k base price before tax.
  - 4.5GHz, 14 CPU cores, Apple M4 Pro.
    - 10x performance cores, 4x efficiency cores. 16x "Neural engine"
      cores.
    - 20x GPU cores. I don't think Apple does any 3rd party GPUs
      anymore.
    - I think the M4 Max is an upgrade which just bumps up to 32x or
      even 40x GPU cores. Probably not necessary for me.
  - 48GB RAM. This is "unified" memory integrated into CPU I think and
    cannot be upgraded.
    - The 40x GPU M4 Max can do up to 128GB of memory.
  - 2TB SSD. +$400.
    - 1TB is standard, but probably should 2x SSD space if this computer
      were to be used ~5yrs.
  - 3456x2234 16.2" display (16:10 aspect ratio)
    - +$150 for "nano texture display."
  - 100 Wh battery (15-22hr claimed)
  - Ports
    - USB-C MagSafe 3. MagSafe 3 cable has USB-C power on one side, and
      MagSafe 3 connector on other side.
    - 3x Thunderbolt 5 (USB 4.0 80Gbps).
    - HDMI
    - 3.5mm headphone jack (really?)
    - An SDXC card reader (nice!).
  - Explicitly says can drive 2x 6k@60Hz via USB-C. And can do 1x
    8k@60Hz over HDMI (but doesn't say about whether it can do this over
    USB-C).
  - GeekBench 6 Single/Multi core scores: 3870/22448.
    - +180%/+246% over current machine.
