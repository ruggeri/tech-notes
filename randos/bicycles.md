# Basics of Single Speed Bicycle

- You've got the _pedals_.
- Pedals are attached to the _cranks_, the arms attached to the
  chainring.
- The cranks are attached to the _chainring_. On my bike there is one
  chainring, but there are often multiple on a multi-speed bike.
- Aside on definitions:
  - The distinction between sprocket and gear is based on use. Gears
    mesh with other gears. Sprockets mesh with a chain.
  - The disc with teeth is called a _cogwheel_. The teeth are called
    _cogs_. Thus both sprockets and gears are cogwheels.
  - People often just call a cogwheel a cog. Especially on the rear of
    the bike.
  - The word chainring is reserved for the front sprocket, even though
    of course there's a chain on the ring at the back, too.
- One shifter is going to shift between the chainrings.
- The chainring is what drives the _chain_, which is in turn connected
  to the rear sprocket in a single-speed bike. I'll talk more about
  casettes and freewheels in a moment.
- When you have a single speed, the gear ratio is going to be determined
  by the ratio of (1) the number of front chainring teeth and (2) the
  number of rear sprocket teeth. Basically: the ratio in circumference
  (or, likewise, radius or diameter), of the two wheels.
- Of course, higher gear ratios will result in more work done per turn.
  Thus you will need more force to turn the cranks. Lower gears means
  work done per turn will drop, which means you can turn the cranks with
  less force.
- On the other hand, at low gear ratios, you will need to rotate the
  pedals rapidly simply to keep up with the rotation of the rear wheel.
  This rotation is effectively wasted work of you circling your legs
  around. Your legs can only do a maximum RPM, so your top speed is
  limited by low gear ratios.

# Coasting

- On single-speed, non-"fixed-gear" bicycles, you can _coast_. This is
  because of a _freewheel_.
- A freewheel is a bit like a ratchet. It consists of two nested wheels.
  The outer wheel is driven by the chain, and the inner rotates with the
  wheel of the bicycle.
- There is a ratcheting mechanism where, when the chain part is driven
  fast, it grabs the inner wheel and drags it forward.
- However, when the inner wheel is moving faster, it just slides (or
  clicks) past the outer wheel. It does not try to drag the chain wheel
  backward.
- This allows you to coast.
- How do "coaster" bikes (the ones where you turn the pedals backward to
  brake) work? I don't care.

# Practical

- Important reminder: lower gear ratio means greater magnification of
  the input force. That is: lower gear ratio means easier pedalling.
- The "granny" gear on a chainring is the _smallest_ one. This results
  in the lowest gear ratio. It means that a turn of the pedals results
  in the least turn of the rear wheels.
- That means that the force required to turn the rear wheel with
  constant resistance is least.
- Internal hub gears have a minimum _input_ gear ratio. This is
  determined by the chainring and rear cog.
- The reason is that the internal hub gear can only handle so much
  torque. If you exceed this, you're going to tear the hub apart.
- The minimum input gear ratio is maxing some assumptions about the
  strength of the rider. In particular, their weight matters. How much
  force would be input (pre-magnification) if the cyclist stood on the
  pedals?
- It also matters what the _crank length_ is. Greater crank length means
  more torque applied to the chainring.
- So if you are lightweight, weak, or have very short cranks, you should
  be able to violate the minimum input ratio for the hub gear.

# Chain

- The distance between chain pins in standardized to 1/2 inch.
- However, chains come in different widths between the plates. 1/8"
  width is common for hub gears.
- There are various chain speeds. Basically, the higher the chain speed,
  the narrower the chain is inclusive of the plates. That's because a
  too-wide chain will rub against the other gears on the rear cog.
- People say that higher speed chains may be less durable, because they
  have to be narrower/smaller.
