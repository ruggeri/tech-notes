# Basics of Single Speed Bicycle

- You've got the _pedals_.
- Pedals are attached to the _cranks_, the arms attached to the
  chainring.
- The cranks are attached to the _chainring_. On my bike there is one
  chainring, but there are often multiple on a multi-speed bike.
- Aside on definitions:
  - The distinction between sprocket and gear is based on use. Gears
    mesh with other gears. Sprockets mesh with a chain.
  - The disc with teeth is called a _cogwheel_. The teeth are called
    _cogs_. Thus both sprockets and gears are cogwheels.
  - People often just call a cogwheel a cog. Especially on the rear of
    the bike.
  - The word chainring is reserved for the front sprocket, even though
    of course there's a chain on the ring at the back, too.
- One shifter is going to shift between the chainrings.
- The chainring is what drives the _chain_, which is in turn connected
  to the rear sprocket in a single-speed bike. I'll talk more about
  casettes and freewheels in a moment.
- When you have a single speed, the gear ratio is going to be determined
  by the ratio of (1) the number of front chainring teeth and (2) the
  number of rear sprocket teeth. Basically: the ratio in circumference
  (or, likewise, radius or diameter), of the two wheels.
- Of course, higher gear ratios will result in more work done per turn.
  Thus you will need more force to turn the cranks. Lower gears means
  work done per turn will drop, which means you can turn the cranks with
  less force.
- On the other hand, at low gear ratios, you will need to rotate the
  pedals rapidly simply to keep up with the rotation of the rear wheel.
  This rotation is effectively wasted work of you circling your legs
  around. Your legs can only do a maximum RPM, so your top speed is
  limited by low gear ratios.

# Coasting

- On single-speed, non-"fixed-gear" bicycles, you can _coast_. This is
  because of a _freewheel_.
- A freewheel is a bit like a ratchet. It consists of two nested wheels.
  The outer wheel is driven by the chain, and the inner rotates with the
  wheel of the bicycle.
- There is a ratcheting mechanism where, when the chain part is driven
  fast, it grabs the inner wheel and drags it forward.
- However, when the inner wheel is moving faster, it just slides (or
  clicks) past the outer wheel. It does not try to drag the chain wheel
  backward.
- This allows you to coast.
- How do "coaster" bikes (the ones where you turn the pedals backward to
  brake) work? I don't care.

# Freewheel vs Freehub

- Freewheel means "overrunning clutch," just as described above.
- But in bicycle terminology, it is even a little more specific. It
  presumes that the clutch is integrated into the *gear assembly*.
- The gear assembly (the stack of gears), would have the freewheel
  clutch built into the assembly. The cogset would be called a
  *freewheel*.
- In old days, you couldn't re-gear your bike at all. And the axle was
  dumb and you just screwed the freewheel into it.
- Eventually, they started producing *freehubs*. This integrated the
  freewheel clutch into the axle body.
- At the same time, the freehub, which is generally heavy plastic,
  would get splines.
- You would then split a stack of sprockets onto the splines. This
  stack is called a *cassette*.
- A final lock ring would screw into the final sprocket, holding
  everything in place.
- I believe the major advantage of the cassette design is that the
  clutch would be located directly over the bearing that transfered
  force from the axle to the wheel. But I actually don't understand
  why that matters right now?
  - It's okay not to understand everything. It's helpful at least to
    be able to identify freewheel and freehub mechanisms.

# Axle and Hub

- The axle is what affixes to the frame.
- The hub is where the spokes affix to. Also, the cogset is screwed or
  splined and locked to the hub.
- The axle passes through the hub.
- Note that the hub will be spinning whenever the wheel is spinning.
- The axle is never spinning.
- This is allowed by **ball bearings**.
- The bearings are packed into a cup, and then a cone is screwed in to
  hold them in place.
- The cup and cone are called *races*.
- As dirt enters the races, it can interfere with the rolling
  friction. Eventually, you can even crack and damage the races. In
  that case, they would need to be replaced.
- This is what happened to us at Burning Man once.

# Practical

- Important reminder: lower gear ratio means greater magnification of
  the input force. That is: lower gear ratio means easier pedalling.
- The "granny" gear on a chainring is the _smallest_ one. This results
  in the lowest gear ratio. It means that a turn of the pedals results
  in the least turn of the rear wheels.
- That means that the force required to turn the rear wheel with
  constant resistance is least.
- Internal hub gears have a minimum _input_ gear ratio. This is
  determined by the chainring and rear cog.
- The reason is that the internal hub gear can only handle so much
  torque. If you exceed this, you're going to tear the hub apart.
- The minimum input gear ratio is maxing some assumptions about the
  strength of the rider. In particular, their weight matters. How much
  force would be input (pre-magnification) if the cyclist stood on the
  pedals?
- It also matters what the _crank length_ is. Greater crank length means
  more torque applied to the chainring.
- So if you are lightweight, weak, or have very short cranks, you should
  be able to violate the minimum input ratio for the hub gear.

# Chain

- The distance between chain pins in standardized to 1/2 inch.
- However, chains come in different widths between the plates. 1/8"
  width is common for hub gears.
- There are various chain speeds. Basically, the higher the chain speed,
  the narrower the chain is inclusive of the plates. That's because a
  too-wide chain will rub against the other gears on the rear cog.
- People say that higher speed chains may be less durable, because they
  have to be narrower/smaller.

# Bicycle Tires

Holy sweet Jesus. There are so many naming conventions.

My bicycle wheels are sometimes called 700C (French system). It is
more modernly called **ISO 622**. This is the diameter from "bead
seats" (where the tire will make contact with the wheel). In road
biking, ISO 622 is by far the most prevelant wheel size.

I believe 700C refers to the outer diameter, including the tire. But
because tire height affects outer diameter, you won't always arrive at
700mm. Also, the bead seat diameter (622mm) is much more important for
fitting the tire properly. That's because the tire needs to sit on the
rim, which is an inner diameter.

The next thing to account for is the tire size. My tires are 23mm
wide. Thus, they are labeled **23-622**, which is a ETRTO (European
Tyre and Rim Technical Organisation) standard. The alternative, French
style label for my tire is 700x23C.

While 700C is the most common wheel size, there are a variety of tire
widths. 23mm used to be quite popular, but tire widths have gotten
greater over the years. Something something contact patch and cushy
ride. People recommend 25mm or 26mm nowadays, or even more!

It appears that 29" is a marketing term for ISO 622? This seems to
come out of mountain bike terminology?

# My Bicycle Specifications

- I have Velocity Deep V 700C wheels. These are ISO 622 wheels.
  - They are 32 spoke wheels.
- My tires are 23-622 tires. The Velocity folks say I could go up to
  28mm without problem.
- I have 42 teeth on the front chain ring.
- I have 20 teeth on the back sprocket.
- I have an Shimano Alfine 8 internal gear hub.
  - Alfine says you should not exceed 1.9:1 gear ratio of front chain
    ring to back sprocket.
  - My gear ratio is 2.1. So I could maybe gain 10% more torque
    without exceeding the maximum input gear ratio.
  - At the lowest ratio of 0.53:1 in the hub, you get a total lowest
    ratio of 1.11. That's your easiest gear.
  - With the highest gear you have a gear ratio of 3.39.
  - Has gear ratio range of 307%.
- Assuming my 23-622 tire size, a gear ratio of 1.11 gives 29.5 gear
  inches, while a 3.39 ratio gives 90.3 gear inches.
  - Tourers like to have 23 inches and lower. Commuters, who face
    fewer hills and fewer long climbs, probably are fine with higher
    gears and faster speeds.

- Rohloff Speedhub
  - Costs like $1.8k.
  - It's 14 speed.
  - Has gear ratio range of 526%.
  - You can see the range here: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/45655/gear-for-incline-internal-gear-hub
  - Here is a review: https://www.sheldonbrown.com/RohloffHub.html
- Alfine 11
  - Has gear ratio range of 409%.
  - However, it has the same low gear of 0.53:1 as the Afline 8.
  - And it has the same 1.9
