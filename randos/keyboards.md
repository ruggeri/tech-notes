- There's the keyboard itself. Some, like they Keychron Q3, have
  hot-swappable key switches. That means you can choose the switches and
  you won't have to solder them into place. It means you can replace a
  broken switch easily.
  - ISO keyboards have a large, shaped return key. ANSI keyboards have
    the straight return key which I prefer. ISO also has another "ALT
    GR" next to the left shift key. That is useful when typing accents.
  - A "tenkeyless" (TKL) keyboard is one which lacks the numberpad. Also
    called an 80% keyboard because it typically has 87 or 88 keys rather
    than 104/105 on ANSI/ISO keyboards. That's approximately 80% of the
    keys.
  - There are also "75%" and "65%" keyboards which are even a bit
    smaller than a tenkeyless board. 65% usually doesn't have function
    keys. 75% uses just one column of "extra" keys to the left of the
    main keyboard section, whereas TKL uses three columns. 75% keyboards
    usually lack F11 and F12 for instance.
- The switches handle the actuation. Cherry is a traditional
  manufacturer. Cherry MX is the traditional switches (though lots of
  companies emulate this now).
  - There are three typical kinds: linear switches provide very little
    feedback when pressing, they are smooth. Tactile and clicky keys are
    the ones I like best.
  - On my WASD keyboards I have used both Cherry MX Blue and Cherry MX
    Green switches. These are both the tactile and clicky ones. The
    Green has more actuation force required, so it's more typewriter-y.
  - For the Keychron keyboard I have just bought, I bought MX Blue
    switches, though maybe if I don't love it I'll try MX Greens.
- The keycaps are what you actually touch and mount on top of the keys.
  For my WASD keyboards I selected all blank keycaps.

## Initial Impressions

- I received my Keychron Q3 on 2024-09-05.
- This has the same Cherry blue switches as my WASD keyboard.
- The click is satisfying, but it does feel like the key travel is not
  as deep? That must be an illusion?
- Definitely this keyboard is quieter. I think it might be that the
  metal keyboard frame is more substantial, and there is maybe
  rubberized sound-deadening.
- The switches do feel quite satisfying. I can type very fast on this
  keyboard.
- The keyboard itself feels quite satisfying. I like that it is
  wireless, at least so far. The heft is substantial and the metal
  aluminum feels high quality.
- Maybe the WASD keyboard switches were a little too soft? The Keychron
  and the Cherry blue switches feel like they give a little more
  resistance, which maybe increases accuracy?
- The keycaps are only of so-so quality. The printing is a bit odd, and
  the kerning/placement of the characters is not always consistent. Some
  keys look a bit bolded, while others seem to have normal font weight.
- I do like the black/blue/teal colorscheme, though.
- I think it is nice, and less gimmicky, to have keycaps with letters on
  them. And I think the color design is nicer.
- The WASD keyboard keycaps were starting to fade and get ugly.
- It's also nice that these keycaps seem to have just a bit of texture,
  which means I think my fingertips grip them just a little better.
- This was an expensive purchase of about $325, which is a lot.
  Hopefully this keyboard will last many years. I like that if a single
  switch fails, I should just be able to swap it out. I like that if I
  decide I want Cherry green switches (greater resistance), I could
  simply swap those in.
- This is definitely giving me a superior feel to my WASD keyboard,
  which I purchased 2016-03-05 (I purchased a second 2017-01-05). Cost
  of those was ~$165 and ~$195. Those are quite old, and I typed hard on
  them, so maybe after ~8yrs of use, the switches were failing.
  Definitely at least the "f" key on the WASD keyboard had failed and
  would not consistently type when pressed.
- So I did have to buy a new keyboard eventually. This seems like a
  reasonable choice.
