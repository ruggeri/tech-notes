- There's the keyboard itself. Some, like they Keychron Q3, have
  hot-swappable key switches. That means you can choose the switches and
  you won't have to solder them into place. It means you can replace a
  broken switch easily.
  - ISO keyboards have a large, shaped return key. ANSI keyboards have
    the straight return key which I prefer. ISO also has another "ALT
    GR" next to the left shift key. That is useful when typing accents.
  - A "tenkeyless" (TKL) keyboard is one which lacks the numberpad. Also
    called an 80% keyboard because it typically has 87 or 88 keys rather
    than 104/105 on ANSI/ISO keyboards. That's approximately 80% of the
    keys.
  - There are also "75%" and "65%" keyboards which are even a bit
    smaller than a tenkeyless board. 65% usually doesn't have function
    keys. 75% uses just one column of "extra" keys to the left of the
    main keyboard section, whereas TKL uses three columns. 75% keyboards
    usually lack F11 and F12 for instance.
- The switches handle the actuation. Cherry is a traditional
  manufacturer. Cherry MX is the traditional switches (though lots of
  companies emulate this now).
  - There are three typical kinds: linear switches provide very little
    feedback when pressing, they are smooth. Tactile and clicky keys are
    the ones I like best.
  - On my WASD keyboards I have used both Cherry MX Blue and Cherry MX
    Green switches. These are both the tactile and clicky ones. The
    Green has more actuation force required, so it's more typewriter-y.
  - For the Keychron keyboard I have just bought, I bought MX Blue
    switches, though maybe if I don't love it I'll try MX Greens.
- The keycaps are what you actually touch and mount on top of the keys.
  For my WASD keyboards I selected all blank keycaps.
