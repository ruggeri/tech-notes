AM modulates the *amplitude* of the wave. Like the wave can be "loud"
or "soft".

FM modulates the *frequency* of the wave. That is: how fast it is
oscilating. You can modulate fast or slow.

Both techniques, when time-sliced, can be used to send binary data.

FM rejects noise better than AM typically. Why? I think the answer is
that noise tends to affect the amplitude more than the frequency.

But then my next question is again: why? Why does noise not affect the
frequency particularly? I feel like it makes sense why noise directly
affects AM. It's like someone else was talking, thus modulating the
signal.

But why doesn't it have the same affect on frequencies?

It is true that the "zero crossings" can be affected by added
noise. But I guess the idea is that this won't mess with the frequency
spectrum very much?

Here were some sources. But they didn't totally answer my questions...
