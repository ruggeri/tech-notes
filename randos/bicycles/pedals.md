## Pedal Types

- Plain pedal is a large flat pedal. It's typical on non-road bikes.
- Quill pedals are flat pedals like mine. They are a bit smaller than
  typical platform pedals. They are frequently fitted with a toe clip
  and strap. This helps keep the foot on the pedal.
  - These can be used with regular shoes.
  - For higher performance, you could use a slotted shoe. It has a slot
    that mates with the edge of the quill pedal. You then strap it down
    with the toe strap.
  - This allowed better connection to the bicycle, but it made it hard
    to release the shoe. You would have to loosen the toe-strap to
    release the shoe.
- The most modern variation are _clipless_ pedals. This is very
  confusing, because the shoes do have a clip to connect to the pedal.
  But they don't have the _toe-clip_ and _toe-strap_ that were used on
  quill pedals.
  - Most systems will lock when you step firmly onto the pedal, and
    unlock when you twist the heel.
  - First came LOOK in 1984. But the required clips were large and
    protrude from the sole of the shoe.
  - Shimano introduced SPD (Shimano "Pedaling Dynamics" - stupid
    acronym). These fit into a recess in the sole, and you can walk in
    them.
- Shimano makes a couple kinds of systems.
- SPD
  - SPD allows you to enter from either side of the pedal.
  - Most SPD shoes have some tread. And the cleat is recessed.
  - Generally a good choice for casual use and first-timers.
- SPD-SL is for more serious use.
  - They are lighter. They have a larger cleat area, and a larger pedal
    to stomp on.
  - But they also only have the clip on one side. So harder to start.
  - Also, larger cleat is harder to walk in.
  - SPD-SL is their road-bike version. It uses the LOOK standard. It has
    a protruding clip.
- So those are your two cleat styles from Shimano. But you have a
  variety of pedal options still.
  - They do make flat pedals of course. PD-EF202 is one example.
  - Then they make SPD only pedals. PD-ED500 for instance is dual-sided.
    PD-ES600 is lighter, but single-sided.
  - Then they have SPD/flat pedals, which allow for either SPD or flat
    pedal use. PD-EH500 is an example. Note these only allow clipping on
    one side, the other side is for regular shoes.
  - They actually have a number more SPD/flat pedals (T8000, T421,
    M324). People say they are all pretty similar and mostly just
    aesthetically different.

## Threading

- Right pedal has typical right hand thread. But left pedal is left hand
  threaded. This is to ensure they don't unscrew themselves.
- Most pedals have a 9/16" length thread, at 20TPI. This is practically
  a standard, with very rare exception.

## Installation/Removal

- Most pedals will have a 15mm wrench flat for you to grab onto.
- Often they will also have a slot for a 6mm allen wrench.
- You can buy a Park Tool pedal wrench (PW-5), but it isn't really
  necessary.
  - Also, you can't use it with a torque wrench.
  - They do sell a 15mm crow foot (TWB-15) you can use with a torque
    wrench. But you're better off just buying a crow foot set if you
    need that.
  - Actually, I would say that the Park Tool crow foot could be worth it
    because it is narrow and large. My generic crow foot worked poorly
    with regard to fitting in the tight space required.
