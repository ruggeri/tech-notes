- As a review:
  - Pedals won't be discussed here.
  - Cranks are what the pedals screw into. They convert reciprocating
    motion into rotational motion.
  - The chainrings are the sprockets at the front and attached to the
    crankset. You have one, two or three chainrings.
  - The cranks are secured to a **bottom bracket**. This consists of a
    _spindle_ which connects the two opposite cranks, and a bearing
    assembly in which the spindle rotates.
  - The **bottom bracket shell** is the part of the bicycle frame in
    which the bottom bracket will rest. It is an open cylinder.
- Bottom Bracket Sizing
  - The bottom bracket is typically screwed into the bicycle bottom
    bracket shell. Questions include: what is the thread pitch, what is
    the thread orientation, and what is the width of the bracket shell?
  - The British/ISO system is by far the most common. It specifies
    thread pitch and orientations. It also specifies a shell width of
    68mm.
  - The Italian system is used on Italian and high-end French cycles. It
    expects a 70mm shell size.
- The spindle needs to turn, so it needs bearings to reduced the
  friction.
  - Typically, these bearings would sit inside the space defined by the
    bottom bracket shell. That was the traditional way.
  - More recently, we have _outboard bearings_. Here, the bearings
    actually sit outside the bottom bracket shell. The bottom bracket
    extends beyond the shell.
  - This allows the use of larger bearings.
- Let's now begin talking about bottom brackets and how the cranks
  attach.
- The traditional way is a _tapered square_ spindle end. The cranks
  will be screwed onto this square. As the crank is screwed down, it
  will bind more-and-more with the tapered square.
  - All tapered squares use a 2 deg taper (relative to the centerline).
    However, there are two different spindle end length.
  - The ISO way run longer, and thus taper down smaller. Most
    European/US cranks/bottom brackets expect ISO. In particular,
    Campagnolo.
  - The JIS are spindle ends are shorter, and thus don't taper as much.
    Most Japanese cranks/bottom brackets expect JIS. In particular,
    Shimano.
- Typically the typical square taper spindle will be a _cartridge bottom
  bracket_.
  - That means that the bearings are integrated with the bottom bracket.
    The bearings are not replaceable, so when they fail you have to
    replace the whole bracket.
  - This became dominant because it was annoying to adjust systems where
    you could replace the bearings.
- Let's talk about how the crank arm is secured. First, we know that
  there's a square taper at the spindle end, and there's a corresponding
  square taper on the crank arm. We're going to wedge the arm onto the
  spindle.
  - First, we just press it on.
  - Next, we're going to use a _fixing bolt_. The spindle end has a
    threaded hole to receive the fixing bolt. By torquing this down, we
    push the crank arm onto the spindle end.
    - I believe the fixing bolt for square taper is 8mm.
  - The fixing bolt isn't strictly needed after the crank has been
    secured. But we typically leave it in place.
  - There are threads to attach a dustcover that hides the fixing bolt.
- How do we _remove the crank_?
  - First, remove the dustcap.
  - Then, remove the fixing bolt.
  - The crank is still going to be super-wedged on. How do you remove
    it? Remember, you used the fixing bolt to secure it.
  - You need to use a **crank puller** tool. This screws into threads on
    the crank arm. Then, after thread this, you start turning another
    part of the crank puller. This extends a smaller interior cylinder
    which can press on the spindle end to unwedge the crank.
  - Basically, it's the opposite of what you did with the fixing bolt.
  - With very rare exception, the dustcap threads you screw the
    crankpuller to are standardized. We have a Park tool to do this.
- My discussion so far has focused on standard **three-piece** cranks.
  - Here you have (1) the bottom bracket and spindle, (2) the left
    crank, (3) the right crank.
- Other three-piece systems.
  - ISIS Drive (ten splines).
  - Shimano Octolink (eight splines).
  - I don't want to go into the potential pros/cons of these systems too
    much. I think it was basically about a larger spindle.
  - What we see with these splined systems is that there is _still a
    taper_ behind the splining. That's necessary for the crank to be
    crammed onto the spindle.
  - These systems are basically dead though. They never became standards
    like the square taper system, and manufacturers have moved onto
    their proprietary two-piece systems with outboard bearings.
  - Because the cranks are still secured in the typical way, you'll
    still need the crank puller, which works in the typical way.
  - I believe that these systems may use larger fixing bolts, which may
    require a different gauge crank-puller.
- An alternative on cheap bicycles is the **one-piece** or **Ashtabula**
  crank. This is the kind that gave me trouble at Burning Man.
  - A single piece of steal forms both arms and the spindle.
  - You can thread this through bottom bracket shell. You then slip
    bearing cartridges over.
  - I believe that the bearings are not sealed, and thus dirt/dust
    infiltration is the worst for this style.
- Last, we can talk about **two-piece** cranks.
  - These are more modern. Shimano's system is called "Hollowtech II",
    SRAM's is called "Giga-X-Pipe", and Campagnolo's is called
    "Ultra-Torque".
  - All these systems have outboard bearings.
  - Here, the bottom bracket is basically just a hole into which the
    spindle will be inserted.
  - The right crank is integrated with the spindle. The left crank is
    then attached directly to the spindle/right crank.
  - Another key difference is the spindle: it's not going to be a square
    taper. It will be splined.
- Shit there are a ton of these two-piece systems. There are very many
  ways to remove the cranks.
  - Campagnolo seems to have three different systems (Power-Torque,
    Ultra-Torque, and Over-Torque). I think you need special tools for
    each of these?
  - Specialized also has their own system S-Works.
  - With these two-piece cranks, you will secure them using a
    _pinch-bolt_. This pinches from either side of the crank to create
    pressure.
- I'll do a quick rundown of removal/installation of Hollowtech II.
  - There are pinch bolts that secure a compression slot of the left
    crank onto the spindle.
  - There's a crank cap that you screw push the crank down onto the
    spindle and up to the bracket. This kind of serves the purpose of
    the fixing bolt in the square taper system.
  - To remove this, you need a proprietary tool to remove the splined
    bolt.
  - However, since this is not the primary way that you secure the crank
    to the spindle, you can normally take the crank off by hand, or with
    soft tapping with a mallet.
  - That is: you don't need a crank puller.
- We skipped how bottom bracket is screwed in.
  - I will focus on threaded-shell brackets. That, I believe, is typical
    of the square-taper style and the outboard bearing styles that are
    popular today.
  -
- I should note that there are many kinds of systems, but the ones that
  I have discussed predominate.

    that installed?
  - The typical is threaded-shell. But there is also press-fit (which I
    think was a 90s fad), and thread-together brackets.
