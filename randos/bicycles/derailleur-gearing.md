## Bikes We Own/Have Owned

- My current IGH bike:
  - 29.5 to 90.3 gear inches.
  - 1.10 to 3.38 ratio.
  - This is a 306% gear range.
  - The typical step between gears is ~17.3% (assuming 8 evenly placed
    gears, which is wrong).
  - https://ritzelrechner.de/?GR=SHA8&KB=46&RZ=22&UF=2135&TF=90&SL=2.6&UN=KMH&DV=gearInches
- Anastassia's Schwinn Traveler III
  - 52x39 crankset. 14-28 six-speed freewheel.
  - 37.3 to 99.4 gear inches.
  - This is a 266% gear range.
- Anastassia's Trek Fx 2 Disc
  - 46x30 crankset. 9-speed HG200 11-36T cassette.
  - 22.3 to 112 gear inches.
    - About 25% easier than my bike, and 24% faster.
  - 0.83 to 4.18 ratio.
    - This is both significantly lower than Anastassia's old bike, and
      significantly higher.
  - This is a 502% gear range.
  - There are 12 distinct gears here.
  - That corresponds to an average 15.8% step between gears.
    - A little closer than my own bike.
    - Though this is pretty steep gearing if compared to race-type
      bikes.

## Common Single Setups

- These are typically fitness bikes. I can look more into them in the
  future.

## Common Double Setups

- XX-YY cogset means that the smallest cog has XX teeth and the largest
  has YY teeth.
- Pros typically use a "standard" 53x39 chainset.
  - An 11-23T cogset gives 45.4 to 129 gear inches.
    - 53% harder and 42% faster than my Alfine 8 bike.
    - 284% gear range. 6.7% gear step.
    - Assumes 17 evenly spaced distinct gears in a 2x11 setup.
  - An 11-25T cogset gives 41.7 to 129 gear inches.
    - 41% harder and 42% faster than my Alfine 8 bike.
    - 309% gear range. 7.3% gear step.
  - You also sometimes see 52x39 and sometimes 54x40.
  - This used to be standard. Anastassia's Schwinn bike had a 52x39
    crankset.

- Semi-compact chainset is 52x36.
  - Typically preferred by strong riders who want to step up from a
    compact chainset.
  - An 11-25T cogset gives 38.5 to 126 gear inches.
    - 30% harder and 40% faster than my Alfine 8 bike.
    - 327% gear range.
  - Compared to standard chainset, gives a 7.7% easier lowest gear. But
    wider gear spacing.
- A "compact" chainset is 50x34.
  - This was recommended by GCN for a first road bike.
  - An 11-25T cogset gives 36.4 to 122 gear inches.
    - 23% harder and 35% faster than my Alfine 8 setup.
    - 335% gear range.
  - An 11-28T cogset gives 32.5 to 122 gear inches.
    - 10% harder and 35% faster than my Alfine 8 setup.
    - 375% gear range.
  - An 11-30T cogset gives 30.3 to 122 gear inches.
    - 2.7% harder and 35% faster than my Alfine 8 setup.
    - 401% gear range.
  - An 11-32T cogset gives 28.4 to 122 gear inches.
    - 4% _easier_ and 35% faster than my Alfine 8 setup.
    - 429% gear range.
    - 8.9% gear step size (assuming ~18 distinct gears in 2x11 setup).
      - In a 2x10 setup might have ~16 distinct gears.
      - That gives 10.2% gear step size.
    - This was recommended by GCN for a first road bike.

  - An 11-34T cogset gives 26.8 to 122 gear inches.
    - 9% _easier_ and 35% faster than my Alfine 8 setup.
    - 455% gear range.
    - 9.3% gear step size (assuming ~18 distinct gears in 2x11 setup).
  - An 11-36T cogset gives 25.3 to 122 gear inches.
- Summary
  - A 50x34 11-28T setup is probably too hard for me.
  - A 50x34 11-30T setup probably is also too hard for me.
    - Ex: Trek Emonda ALR 5 ($2,300).
  - A 50x34 and 11-32T setup does make sense if I'm not particularly
    afraid of hills. It would be somewhat easier and quite a bit faster
    than my current setup, with much closer spacing.
    - Ex: Trek Domane AL 4 Disc ($2,100).
      - This is 10-speed at the rear, though.
    - Ex: Specialized Allez Elite ($1,700).
  - A 50x34 and 11-34T setup would make sense if I'm scared of hills,
    and want something a fair bit easier. It is still quite a bit
    faster.
    - Gear spacing is much better than Alfine 8.
    - Slightly steeper than 11-32T, but not if the 11-32 is 10-speed.
    - Ex: Trek Domane AL 5 Disc ($2,100).

## Gravel

- 48x32 and 46x30 are called _subcompact_.
- The 46x30 seems fairly popular.
  - An 11-34T cogset gives 23.6 to 112 gear inches.
    - 20% easier and 24% faster than my Alfine 8 setup.
    - 475% gear range.
    - 9.6% gear step size (assuming ~18 distinct gears in 2x11 setup).
    - Seems like a reasonable choice, competing with 50x34 11-34T.
      - Probably slightly more centered around my desired speeds.
      - Maintains a good gear spacing.
    - Ex: Trek Checkpoint ALR 5.
    - http://ritzelrechner.de/?GR=DERS&KB=30,46&RZ=11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,30,34&UF=2135&TF=90&SL=2.8&UN=KMH&DV=gearInches
  - An 11-36T cogset gives 22.3 to 112 gear inches.
    - 24.5% easier and 24% faster than my Alfine 8 setup.
    - 502% gear range.
    - 11% gear step size (assuming ~16 distinct gears in 2x10 setup)
      - Shimano don't make this in 11 speed I think?
    - Probably unnecessary wide gear range.
    - Ex: Anastassia's Trek FX 2 (except this is 9-speed).

## Road Triple

- The most typical setup appears to be 50/39/30.
  - Note that this is a standard with a granny gear.
- Now that compact chainsets are common, the triple appears to be
  dying (at least outside touring bikes).
  - The top manufacturers do not include triples on their top lines.
- With 10 and 11 speed cogsets, you can run a wide range with close
  ratios even on a double chainset.
- Triples have the downside of more weight, and worse chainlines.
  Also, there is a lot of duplication in the gear ratios.
- However, they still might appeal to novices in hilly areas.
  Especially if they want to pedal uphill while seated.
