**Derailleur Road Bike Comparison**

- XX-YY cogset means that the smallest cog has XX teeth and the largest
  has YY teeth.
- Pros typically use a "standard" 53x39 chainset.
  - An 11-23 cogset gives a minimum of 45 gear inches.
  - An 11-25 cogset gives a minimum of 42 gear inches.
- Semi-compact chainset is 52x36.
  - Typically preferred by strong riders who want to step up.
  - Most commonly paired with 11-25 cogset.
  - Gives a minimum of 38 gear inches.
- A "compact" chainset is 50x34.
  - This was recommended by GCN for a first road bike.
  - An 11-25 cogset gives 36.4 gear inches.
  - An 11-28 cogset gives 32.5 gear inches.
  - An 11-32 cogset gives 28.4 gear inches.
    - This was recommended by GCN for a first road bike.
    - Note that this would be about 5% easier than my Alfine 8 setup.
  - An 11-34 cogset gives 26.8 gear inches.
    - I believe this is the most that Shimano can do. Their derailleur
      is the limit.
  - An 11-36 cogset gives 25.3 gear inches (SRAM).
- Subcompact 48x32 and 46x30 chainsets exist.
  - These are for adventure and touring cyclists.
- Road Triple
  - The most typical setup appears to be 50/39/30.
    - Note that this is a standard with a granny gear.
  - Now that compact chainsets are common, the triple appears to be
    dying (at least outside touring bikes).
    - The top manufacturers do not include triples on their top lines.
  - With 10 and 11 speed cogsets, you can run a wide range with close
    ratios even on a double chainset.
  - Triples have the downside of more weight, and worse chainlines.
    Also, there is a lot of duplication in the gear ratios.
  - However, they still might appeal to novices in hilly areas.
    Especially if they want to pedal uphill while seated.
