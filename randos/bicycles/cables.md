Cables are responsible for controlling the brake and shifting systems.

## Cable Components

- There is an inner, metal cable. This is a coil of twisted metal
  strands. For brakes, this is thicker, and for shifting, it is thinner.
  The difference is that brakes must handle greater forces/loads.
- There is the housing. This looks like plastic, but it is only plastic
  on the outside. It's actually a helical steel cable. (Except see later
  about SIS cable).
- Often, there is a plastic liner between the inner cable and the
  helical housing. This reduces friction.
- Older cables lacked the liner, and you would want to add a little oil
  at the ends so there was less friction between inner cable and
  housing. You don't have to do that now.
- The ends of the inner wire have an anchor. Flat-bar brake levers want
  a cylindrical shape, while drop-bar brake levers want a mushroom
  shape. Cables will often come with both ends and you cut the one you
  don't need.
- Shifter cables want a cylindrical end.
- Last, you have ferrules at the end of the housing. These don't need to
  be crimped on. We'll talk about their use soon.
- At the derailleur or brake, you'll typically have an exposed inner
  cable secured by a washer and screw. You'll want to crimp an endcap
  here. This stops the cable from fraying.

## How Cables Work

- Consider the brakes. You pull on the inner cable at the brake lever,
  which transmits force to the cable. This pull wants to pull on where
  the cable is anchored at the brake. This pulls the brake closed.
- Now, if it were a straight-line run from lever to brake, we would be
  done. But we need to transmit a pull through at least one bend: from
  lever to frame.
- How can this be done? In particular, if there were no housing and the
  cable simply ran from the lever to the frame, then a pull would have
  the effect of simply "straightening out" the bend. No force would be
  transmitted to the brake.
- If there were no bend or slack in the cable (if the cable ran straight
  from the lever to the frame) then how could you turn the handlebars?
  Also, there would be a lot of friction at the point where the cable
  makes a sharp change in direction.
- Thus we have cable housing. The inner cable runs through the housing.
  The housing terminates with ferrules at the lever and frame.
- When you pull on the cable, the housing doesn't want to straighten
  out. It cannot do this, because the helical housing cannot be
  compressed.
- Thus, when pulling the inner cable, it must transmit the force all the
  way to the end. It cannot simply shorten the route from lever to
  frame.
- The ferrules may or may not be strictly necessary. But they are
  helpful in providing a solid, square mating of the housing to the
  lever.
- Note that pulleys can be used when a cable without housing needs to
  change direction. This could happen at the frame, but not anywhere
  where the distance traveled must change (like at the handlebars)

## Bowden Apply Opposite Force On Inner And Outer Cables

- Sheldon Brown insists that a Bowden cable transmits two kinds of
  force.
- We know you're applying a pull to the inner cable.
- Because friction, the housing would want to move forward with the
  inner cable. But it cannot, because the ferrule is held in place by
  the lever entrypoint.
- Thus, there is a push _back_ on the housing.
- Isn't friction bad between the inner wire and housing bad? Yes. But
  we know that the inner cable wants to straighten out to take a
  shorter path.
- Older, possibly wrong logic (second order effect):
  - But the housing cannot straighten out. The only way it could is to
    push out on both ends of the housing at the ferrules.
  - Again, this describes why the cable housing receives a push when the
    inner cable receives a pull.
  - This effect matters for side-pull brakes. Here, the inner cable
    pulls one brake arm closed, while the housing pushes the other brake
    arm closed. The two forces are equal!
  - I think this must be wrong. First, it relies on friction. Second, it
    seems like a minor effect. Third, you can eliminate it if you had a
    straight run of cable.
- With regard to side-pull brakes: I think I have missed the point. The
  inner wire wants to pull the one side closed. But the way the brake is
  set up, this will want to rotate _both arms_.
- If that happened, the two brakes arms would rotate together, not
  close. Only one side would come in contact with the rim.
- The housing constrains the second arm from rotating. This redirects
  the force to closing the second brake arm.

## Index Compatible Cable

- Shimano introduced SIS (Shimano Indexing System) cables for indexed
  shifting.
- You must never use SIS for brakes; the housing is not strong enough!
- The housing helical coil is replaced by longitudinal strands of wire.
  - This housing wants neither to be compressed _nor_ stretched out.
- It's best to use a bicycle specific cable cutter for SIS cable.
  Otherwise it won't cut cleanly.
