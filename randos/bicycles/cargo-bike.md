# Concept

- Plan is to replace 90% of car trips I take inside of San Francisco.
- I want to be able to take 2x children to daycare, to friends' houses,
  to playgrounds, pick up groceries, to the beach.
- I want to park easily. I don't want to be stressed about finding
  parking near my destination.
- Daycare is an 11min drive or an 18min bike. But I often spend 5min
  looking for parking around home.
- Utility of bike probably scales with number of stops made on a journey
  (number of parking spots needed to be found). For example, driving to
  playground or a friend's house after daycare adds 1x parking.
- Also, it's a fun family trip to travel by bicycle.

# Requirements

- I want seating in front to hold 2x children.
- I want disc brakes.
- I want a Rohloff speedhub. I don't like the slop/inefficiency of
  Enviolo (experienced in Copenhagen). I like wide gear range, no
  derailleur or chainrings.
- I think I want the premium ride of a full suspension. Very few cargo
  bikes offer that. In Copenhagen we had our bones shaken quite a bit.
- Probably a single 725Wh battery can do 50km (by reports online). That
  sounds like plenty for my needs, even with hills. I can charge every
  night. If a 2nd battery were needed can't I just buy and carry one?

# Bosch Motors

- Load4 Rohloff HS uses Bosch Performance BDU378Y.

- Load4 Rohloff uses Bosch Cargo BDU374Y.
  - 85Nm, 400% support, supports to 20mph, 250W continuous, 600W peak.

- They have hill hold and walking assist.
- Newer Bosch motors can do 100Nm.

# Riese and Muller vs Urban Arrow

- Prices as of 2025-08-12.
- Urban Arrow Family
  - It has a Bosch 75Nm motor.
  - It only offers Enviolo transmission.
  - It doesn't have full suspension.
  - Weighs 110lbs.
  - $8k or $9k
- Load4
  - 60cm: Rohloff $13k. Rohloff HS $13.7k. Vario $11.4k.
  - 75cm: Rohloff $13.3k. Rohloff HS $13.9k. Vario $11.6k.
  - So +15cm is maybe +$250. And +HS is +$300.
- Load5 announced in 2025-05-XX. But not stocked as of 2025-08-XX.
  - Base is RRP $14,219, but add $1,017 for "family kit" which is shell
    and 2x child restraint seats. Basically same design as before.
  - I think this has the 100Nm Bosch motor.
  - What is "performance kit?" It looks like different materials?
  - You can get "IBS" which is basically a linked braking system. Some
    people think this is silly, while others think it helps if you need
    to brake while signalling.
- Based on Rohloff website, I think that Riese and Muller are the only
  company that uses Rohloff for a cargo bike.
