## Maintenance Log

- 2022-06-14
  - Approximately. I changed the inner tube of the rear tire after it
    went flat.
- 2022-06-12
  - I adjusted the seat height up to 148mm. I had previously increased
    it to 138mm from 124mm. This seems to be a good height for me.
- 2022-05-26
  - I replaced the 20T rear sprocket with a 22T sprocket. This should
    reduce my top speed by about 10% but decrease effort in the lowest
    gear by 10%.
  - I replaced the shift cable. I used Jagwire pro shift cable. The
    old cable was not use the linear strands that indexed shifting
    should have.
  - Shift cable replacement was surprisingly easy. I was careful to
    first replace the cable housing and then the inner wire.
  - I adjusted the brake so that it is more flush with the wheel. This
    seems to have reduced some squeaking.
- 2022-05: I cleaned and lubricated the chain.
  - lol, maybe it should have been replaced... But the chain wear tool
    says it's okay!
- 2022-05: I replaced the tires with new Vittoria Zaffiro Pro 25-622
  tires.
  - I also changed the tubes. I used Conti Tube Race 28 tubes.
- 2021-06: I changed the chain.
  - I put on a KMC 9 speed chain.
