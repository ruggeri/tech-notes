## Maintenance Log

- 2022-12-12
  - Greased bicycle chain. Used Squirt Lube. It says don't take off the
    old lube. I did wipe with a rag before to remove accumulated dirt.
  - I also disassembled the shifter. I verified that the shifter was
    (occasionally) not pulling the shift cable. This means the shifter
    gives no resistance, and you don't change gears. It's not a problem
    at the back. I can see that the cable isn't being pulled.
  - In fact, after disassembly, I can even see the ratchet mechanism
    turn, but fail to engage the lever that pulls the cable.
  - The typical solution appears to be to flush with WD-40 and then
    lubricate again with an aerosol grease. I bought some lithium
    aerosol grease to do this in the next couple days.

  - At some previous date (in August presumably), I removed the toe
    cages from my bicycle.
  - I can't decide if I miss them? Certainly the look of the bike is
    cleaner without them. But they did give a bit of a sense of security
    especially while standing on the pedals.
  - They are pitted with rust, and the straps are all beat up from the
    years.
  - I'm going to toss them. They were size L in case I ever want them
    back again.

  - This morning, I loosened cup-and-cone bearing. I also added some
    more grease to the non-drive side bearings. The two changes
    significantly reduced drag. But there was also definitely play in
    the axle. Riding away, I noticed squealing when braking the rear
    wheel. This must be caused by the shaking of the wheel.
  - Otherwise, the bike felt good. It certainly felt less draggy while
    riding. I rode my bay loop. I felt like I could climb some hills in
    third which I normally only do in second.
  - I didn't notice any slipping of the axle nuts after the ride.
    Cleaning maybe helped them grip better?
  - On returning home, I remove the dirt cup from the non-drive side.
    This lets me adjust the bearings while the wheel is on the bike. I
    presume this will be okay for a while, since SF is not that rainy or
    dusty.
  - I adjusted the cup and cone to be tighter. There was still
    significantly less drag than yesterday. When rotating the pedals
    backward, the wheel does not particularly move backward. Much of the
    play from the morning was eliminated.
  - I rode up-and-down the street. The squealing seems to be gone.
    Success?
  - The rear wheel seems straight in the dropouts. I tightened axle nuts
    to 45Nm. I repositioned both front and rear brakes so that they grab
    the rims best. Braking power continues to feel very strong.

  - I noticed some resistance when pedaling, so I decided to service the
    gearhub.
  - I took the wheel off. I did a lot of cleaning and degreasing of the
    frame, rims, and spokes.
  - I removed the gearhub. I disassembled it into its two main parts. I
    put it in degreaser in the ultrasonic. I then regreased it and
    dunked it in automatic transmission fluid.
  - I could not replace the ball bearings at this time, since I didn't
    have the right size. Also, I couldn't access the right-hand cone
    bearings because I lacked a special Shimano disassembly tool.
  - I reinstalled the wheel. I torqued the axle nuts to 45Nm. I had
    recently torqued them to 55Nm after I noticed them slip, but I think
    that was hurting the paint. I degreased the serrated locknuts in the
    ultrasonic. Hopefully that grips better.
  - I also degreased the chain, and regreased it with Squirt Lube.
  - I still notice that the hub is pretty draggy. Was it always this
    draggy? Backpedaling accelerates the wheel backward. Pedaling
    forward, the wheel accelerates, but then if I let go, the cranks
    turn forward on their own.
  - I could try to further grease the hub when I get the necessary parts
    to finish disassembly. Before that, I can see if the same problem
    manifests with the locknuts loosened. I can also try to adjust the
    cup-and-cone bearings on the non-drive side.

  - I took the chain off, cleaned it (sprayed it with Finish Line Speed
    Degreaser in a bucket), and regreased with Tri Flow (removing
    excess).
  - Made sure that rear axle nuts were tightened, centered rear brake,
    checked hub gear cable adjustment.
  - Rode very nicely afterward :-)
- 2022-07-04
  - Approximately. I tightened the rear axle nuts to ~45 Nm per spec.
    They had gotten loose and the wheel moved on me and the chain
    dropped.
  - I also readjusted the alignment of the shift cable at the hub. I got
    much better shifting after that. A big difference!
- 2022-06-14
  - Approximately. I changed the inner tube of the rear tire after it
    went flat.
- 2022-06-12
  - I adjusted the seat height up to 148mm. I had previously increased
    it to 138mm from 124mm. This seems to be a good height for me.
- 2022-05-26
  - I replaced the 20T rear sprocket with a 22T sprocket. This should
    reduce my top speed by about 10% but decrease effort in the lowest
    gear by 10%.
  - I replaced the shift cable. I used Jagwire pro shift cable. The
    old cable was not use the linear strands that indexed shifting
    should have.
  - Shift cable replacement was surprisingly easy. I was careful to
    first replace the cable housing and then the inner wire.
  - I adjusted the brake so that it is more flush with the wheel. This
    seems to have reduced some squeaking.
- 2022-05: I cleaned and lubricated the chain.
  - lol, maybe it should have been replaced... But the chain wear tool
    says it's okay!
- 2022-05: I replaced the tires with new Vittoria Zaffiro Pro 25-622
  tires.
  - I also changed the tubes. I used Conti Tube Race 28 tubes.
- 2021-06: I changed the chain.
  - I put on a KMC 9 speed chain.
