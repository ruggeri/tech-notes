# My Bicycle Specifications

- I have Velocity Deep V 700C wheels. These are ISO 622x14C wheels.
  - They are 32 spoke wheels.
  - https://www.velocityusa.com/product/rims/deep-v-622
- My tires are 25-622 Vittoria Zaffiro Pro tires.
  - The original tires were 23-622 Vittoria Zaffiro Pro tires. I used
    them for about 10 years!
  - I upgraded to 25-622 Vittoria Zaffiro Pro. They seem to give a
    nice ride.
  - The Velocity wheel folks say I could go up to 28mm without problem.
  - I don't think my frame could do 28mm. There isn't enough clearance
    at the frame. It alsoe wouldn't fit between the brake levers
    inflated.
- My bottom bracket is a Shimano (presumably) square spindle.
  - It has 20 internal splines, and requires BBT-22 to install or
    remove.
  - The bottom bracket shell is 68mm so appears to be ISO/British.
  - I didn't measure the spindle length. That matters for chainline.
- My front chain ring is an Origin 8 Track/SS crankset.

  - It has 165mm cranks.
  - It has 46 teeth.
  - I expect it is for 3/32 chain.
    - I don't see a marking on the chainring.
    - But I've used 9-speed chain fine on this.
    - Also, the standard Alfine rear cog is 3/32, rather than 1/8.
  - This costs about $115 new.
  - lmao, Origin 8 just stamps Lasco CF 12. It's no-name made-in-Taiwan
    rebrand.
  - I measured a 42.5mm chainline, which corresponds to the 42mm
    indicated as intended on the Origin 8 specifications.
    - Note: 42mm is a typical single-speed chainline.
- I have 22 teeth on the rear sprocket.
  - I replaced the stock Alfine 20T sprocket with a Shimano 22T. It is
    3/32.
  - The manual says you should use 9 speed chain. In that case, one
    expects it is 3/32.
- Chain
  - I am running a KMC 9 speed chain.
  - I use a 9-speed KMC Missing Link.
  - BTW, Shimano claim that you should use a 9 speed chain with the
    Alfine rear cog. That implies it is a 3/32 sprocket. Thus I'm using
    the right chain.
- I have an Shimano Alfine 8 internal gear hub.
  - The lowest gear in the hub has a ratio 0.53:1.
  - The highest gear you have a gear ratio of 1.62:1.
  - Thus we have a gear ratio range of 307%.
- My Gear Ratios
  - I run an input gear ratio of 2.1. So my lowest gear is effectively
    1.10:1, and my highest gear is effectively 3.38:1.
  - I have a 25-622 tire on.
  - Thus, my gear inches run from 29.5 to 90.3.

- Seat height
  - There is a proper way to measure saddle height. But I simply
    measured the extension from the top of the tube to the base where
    the saddle is mounted.
  - I adjusted recently from a height of 124mm to 138mm. That's about
    half an inch difference.

## Gear Ratio Upgrade?

- I wanted to increase the mechanical advantage of my lowest gear. This
  means I could climb hills with less force on my knees.
- I would give up some top-speed by doing this.
- Smaller tires. This is a minimal improvement, since the wheel size
  remains the same.
- Smaller wheels: can't easily fit them to the bike. And the smaller
  your wheels are, the more you will feel bumps.
- More teeth on rear sprocket. Shimano makes a 22T sprocket for the
  Alfine/Nexus system.
  - I did this! It made a noticeable and very helpful difference!
  - Read elsewhere about limitations on the Alfine 8 input ratio though!
- Fewer teeth on front chainring.
  - I could, but I'd have to find a different crank.
  - Also, the rear sprocket swap worked nicely already.
- Increase crank length.
  - Origin 8 makes a 170mm crank version.
  - This would affect not only the gear ratio, but also the motion of my
    leg.
  - Maybe in a good way.
