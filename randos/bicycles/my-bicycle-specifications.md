# My Bicycle Specifications

- I have Velocity Deep V 700C wheels. These are ISO 622x14C wheels.
  - They are 32 spoke wheels.
  - https://www.velocityusa.com/product/rims/deep-v-622
- My tires are 25-622 Vittoria Zaffiro Pro tires.
  - The original tires were 23-622 Vittoria Zaffiro Pro tires. I used
    them for about 10 years!
  - I upgraded to 25-622 Vittoria Zaffiro Pro. They seem to give a
    nice ride.
  - The Velocity wheel folks say I could go up to 28mm without problem.
  - I don't think my frame could do 28mm. There isn't enough clearance
    at the frame. It alsoe wouldn't fit between the brake levers
    inflated.
- My front chain ring is an Origin 8 Track/SS crankset.
  - https://origin8.bike/collections/chainrings-cranks/products/track-ss-crankset?variant=40214953164955
  - It has 165mm cranks.
  - It has 46 teeth.
  - I expect it is for 3/32 chain.
    - I don't see a marking on the chainring.
    - But I've used 9-speed chain fine on this.
    - Also, the standard Alfine rear cog is 3/32, rather than 1/8.
  - This costs about $115 new.
  - lmao, Origin 8 just stamps Lasco CF 12. It's no-name made-in-Taiwan
    rebrand.
- I have 20 teeth on the rear sprocket.
  - I bet it is the standard Alfine 20 tooth sprocket. It looks
    similar, and would be standard.
  - The manual says you should use 9 speed chain. In that case, one
    expects it is 3/32.
- Chain
  - I am running a KMC 9 speed chain.
  - I use a 9-speed KMC Missing Link.
- I have an Shimano Alfine 8 internal gear hub.
  - The lowest gear in the hub has a ratio 0.53:1.
  - The highest gear you have a gear ratio of 1.62:1.
  - Thus we have a gear ratio range of 307%.
- My Gear Ratios
  - I run an input gear ratio of 2.3. So my lowest gear is effectively
    1.22:1, and my highest gear is effectively 3.73:1.
  - I have a 25-622 tire on.
  - Thus, my gear inches run from 32.4 to 99.4.

## Torque Upgrade?

- If I wanted to sacrifice top speed for more torque and easier
  hill-climbing, I could make one of a few modifications.
- I could use smaller tires. But that is a minimal improvement.
- I could increase the teeth at the rear sprocket. Shimano makes a 22T
  sprocket for the Alfine/Nexus system.
- I could decrease the teeth at the front chainring.
- I could increase the crank length. Origin 8 makes a 170mm crank
  version.
- The Alfine wants a minimum input gear ratio of 1.9:1.
  - It doesn't want too much torque applied to the gear hub.
    Otherwise, it can be damaged.
  - It's making assumptions about (1) your weight, (2) your strength,
    (3) your crank arm length.
  - Some people violate this input minimum.
  - But if I follow the rules, I could get a 17-18% gain in torque, at
    a decrease of 17-18% in max speed in the top gear.
  - Maybe that would be worth it for my knees in San Francisco. I'm
    not usually in my top gear anyway.
