## Types

- There are many brake types. I'll cover some of the major ones.

**Rim Brakes**

- Braking force is applied to the rim.
- Side-pull caliper brakes are your standard kind.
  - The brake inner cable pulls one of the arms, while the cable housing
    pushes the other arm.
  - The pull happens at one side, thus the name.
  - The dual-pivot style is most common now; single-pivot is only on
    cheap bikes.
  - The dual pivot rotates at two points.
  - This is the style of brake that I have. It is the most common on
    road bikes.
- Center-pull pull a yoke, which pulls a straddle cable that attaches to
  each brake arm.
  - These were once popular on older road-bikes like A's Twin Traveler
    III.
- Cantilever Brakes
  - Traditional cantilever brakes are a lot like center-pull brakes, but
    have pivoting points on the forks located below the wheel rim. The
    pull squeeze the brake arms together.
  - Linear pull brakes are similar, but pull from one side. These are
    also called V-Brakes (Shimano's term), or "direct pull brakes"
    (because they don't go via a yoke).
    - Also sometimes called "noodle" brakes because of the noodle that
      accomplished the 90deg change in brake cable direction required
      for these brakes.
  - Rollercam are another style, popular in the 80s. They work like
    center-pull cantilevers, but they use a triangular/curved cam to
    apply variable mechanical advantage.

**Disk Brakes**

- A brake rotor is mounted on the wheel hub.
- They may be actuated mechanically (via a cable) or hydraulically.
- Previously disk brakes were only common on mountain bikes, since the
  rims would get dirty and brake performance would decrease.
- However, recently they have become popular on road bikes because they
  offer better stopping power.
- A downside is that if the rotor is too small, it might heat up too
  fast, and degrade braking performance.

**Other**

- You have drum brakes, which have shoes enclosed in a rotating
  cylinder.
- Coaster brakes are drum brakes that are actuated by backpedaling.

## Braking Power

- Let's talk about what factors impact braking power.
- First, is the strength of the squeeze: more force on the brake lever
  means more force transmitted to the brake arms.
- Next, the leverage. If you move the handle by 10mm, but the arms move
  by 2mm, then you get an increase in force applied of 5x.
- Next, the brake pad material matters. A greased pad will do nothing,
  for instance. The material determines the coefficient of friction.
- Next, the rotor size matters. How much pad is in contact with the
  rotor? And how much surface area does the rotor have to radiate heat?

**Hydraulic Leverage**

- We know that a relatively long brake pull can translate to a small
  motion of the brake arms, which creates **mechanical leverage**.
- Hydraulic brakes have a second way by which they can increase
  leverage. Imagine that the master piston has a small surface area. The
  caliper pistons have large surface area.
- Then a displacement of the master piston by Xmm will correspond to a
  smaller displacement of Ymm of the caliper pistons.
- This creates a hydraulic leverage/advantage.
- Hydraulic brakes can increase leverage in this way. But leverage can
  also be created mechanically. So hydraulic brakes don't really have a
  "leverage" advantage.
- The advantage of hydraulics is simply that there is very little
  friction loss from the cable moving within the cable housing.

**Other Leverage**

- You want the leverage of the lever to be matched to the expectation of
  the brake.
- For instance, if you have too much mechanical advantage, you will have
  to set the brake pads very close to the wheel, which means the wheel
  will run into them if not perfectly true.
- If you have too little mechanical advantage, you will run out of lever
  travel when trying to brake hard.
- Direct-pull cantilever brakes (V-Brakes) have more mechanical
  advantage than traditional cantilevers. Thus, they need a brake lever
  with more travel.

## Disk vs Rim Brakes

- Rim brakes
  - Have good heat dissipation because size of rim.
  - Also, applying the braking force farthest from the axle is best for
    braking torque.
- Braking is always going to be limited by traction, and you can already
  lock the wheel with rim brakes.
- But people talk about disc brakes having better _modulation_. That is,
  you find the point just before lockup to get maximum braking power.
- People also talk about how disc brakes allow fitting larger tires on
  bikes, which gives better traction and performance. We see 28mm as a
  standard tire size now, rather than 23mm.
- People do have a general sense that the market in road bikes does seem
  to be moving to disc brakes.
