## Possible Upgrades

- Trek FX Sport 6 ($2,800)
  - All carbon.
  - Hydraulic disc brakes.
  - Flat bars.
  - 1x11. 40T chainring and 11-speed 11-42T cassette.
    - 2025: 40T front and 12-speed 11T-44T cassette.
    - GRX RX600 and SLX M7000.
  - 25.5 to 97.3 gear inches.
  - 382% gear range.
  - About 14.3% step.
  - This is about 14% easier and 7% faster than my current bike. With a
    somewhat better step size (14.3% vs 17.3%).
    - That's not that compelling? Probably shows the limit of a 1x
      setup?
    - You can't have a wider range with a lower step-size without going
      to 12-speed in the back, or a second chainring.
    - But this could be fun because of the very simple shifting.
    - By comparison, Anastassia's FX 2 has similar gear step but
      significantly wider range. That's because it's 2x.
  - Probably way lighter. Less resistance too, probably.
  - Other options:
    - FX Sport 5 ($2,100) is all-carbon, 1x 40T (GRX RX600), 11-speed
      11-42T (SLX M7000).
    - FX Sport 4 ($1,800) is all-carbon, 1x 42T (Prowheel), 10-speed
      11-46T (Deore M4100).
    - FX 3 Disc ($1,050) is aluminum with carbon fork. 1x 40T
      (Prowheel), 10-speed 11-46T (Deore M4100).
    - Trek doesn't sell any 2x city/urban bikes except at below the $1k
      price point.
  - Summary: interesting. Maybe an all-around better version of my
    current bike, but not actually very _different_ from what I already
    have.

- Domane AL 4 Disc ($1,800)
  - Aluminum frame with carbon fork.
  - Hydraulic disc brakes.
  - Drop bars.
  - 2x10. 50x34 chainset and 10-speed 11-32T cassette.
    - This is exactly the beginner GCN recommended setup.
  - This gives 28.4 to 122 gear inches.
    - 4% easier at the bottom than my Alfine, and a lot more room at the
      top.
  - About 16 distinct gears; 10% step between gears.
  - One of the cheapest road bikes in Trek's lineup. Only cheaper bikes
    are AL 2 and AL 3 which have 8 or 9 speeds at back.
  - All Shimano Tiagra components.
  - Summary: A good choice, but I'd be worried about sustained hill
    climbing. I might want a lower lowest-gear than this.

- Domane AL 5 Disc ($2,100)
  - Aluminum frame with carbon fork.
  - Hydraulic disc brakes.
  - Drop bars.
  - Tires: 700x32 (can fit up to 35).
  - 2x11. 50x34 chainset. 11-speed 11-34T in the back.
  - Gives 26.8 to 122 gear inches.
    - That's about 10% easier than my current setup. About 35% faster in
      highest gear.
  - Still about 16 distinct gears (you lose two to cross-chaining, and
    then you have duplicates). So still about 10% step between gears.
  - But, you get a gear range of 455%.
  - All Shimano 105.
  - Summary: pretty compelling. Does the AL 4 one better by giving you
    one more gear at the bottom.
  - https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/bikes/road-bikes/performance-road-bikes/domane/domane-al/domane-al-5-disc/p/33086
- Émonda ALR 5 ($2,300)
  - Aluminum frame with carbon fork.
  - Hydraulic disc brakes.
  - Drop bars.
  - 2x11. 50x34 chainset, 11-speed 11-30T cassette.
  - All Shimano 105.
  - 30.3 to 122 gear inches.
    - 2.7% harder in the lowest gear than my Alfine 8 setup.
  - About 17 different gears. A step of about 9% between gears.
  - Summary: closer gear spacing, but the lowest gear is higher than my
    Alfine setup. Probably makes sense for a stronger cyclist.
  - The Émonda SL 5 Disc ($3,250) is all-carbon, and the cheapest
    all-carbon road bike from Trek.

- Checkpoint ALR 5 ($2,500)
  - Aluminum frame with carbon fork.
  - GRX hydraulic disc brakes.
  - Drop bars.
  - Tires: 700x40.
  - GRX 46x30 chainset. Shimano 105 11-speed 11-34T.
    - 2025 model now uses SRAM Apex 1x12 setup.
    - 40T front cog and SRAM Apex XPLR, 11T-44T rear cogset.
    - That's 25.3 inches to 101 inches.
    - That's 14.5% easier, and 12% faster than my current bike.
  - 23.6 to 112 gear inches.
    - 20% easier in lowest gear. 24% faster in highest gear.
    - Compelling gear range.
  - 474% gear range.
  - About 18 distinct gears.
  - About 9.5% gear step.
  - Summary: gearing seems optimal for my needs. Would have to
    investigate whether I like the tires. Doesn't have a carbon fork?
  - Upgrade: Checkpoint SL 5 ($3,400)
    - Same bike, but all carbon.
    - Summary: could be a good option.
  - https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/bikes/road-bikes/gravel-bikes/checkpoint/checkpoint-alr/checkpoint-alr-5/p/35172
- Domane SL 5 ($3,300)
  - Same setup as AL 5 Disc.
  - Except this is all-carbon.
  - Summary: does it make sense to pay $1,200 to upgrade to all carbon?
    I'm guessing probably not. This is probably the limit of what I
    should consider.
  - https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/bikes/road-bikes/performance-road-bikes/domane/domane-sl/domane-sl-5/p/35298
- Summary of summaries:
  - I doubt the Sport 6 ($2.8k) is worth the money, or different enough
    from my current bike. I think a 1x11 setup is just not enough speeds
    for me?
  - Domane AL 5 Disc ($2.1k) has the right gear range, good spec parts.
    A good carbon-fork option.
    - Palo Alto bikes has it in stock.
  - Checkpoint ALR 5 ($2.5k) beats Domane 5 by having slightly easier
    gearing. Big question: how do I feel about the x40 tires?
    - They have one to try at Valencia Cyclery (58cm)
  - The Domane SL5 ($3.3k) and Checkpoint SL 5 ($3.4k) cost about the
    same. They're all-carbon versions of the Domane AL 5 and Checkpoint
    ALR 5. So it's just a question of whether carbon is worth
    $900-$1.2k.
    - Domane SL5 58cm in stock at Avenue Cyclery.
    - Checkpoint SL 5 requires a trip to Windsor CA.

## Specialized

- Allez Elite ($1,700)
  - 50x34, 11-32T. 11-speed.
  - Aluminum frame and carbon fork.
  - Rim brakes.
  - Competes with Trek Domane AL 4 Disc. Cheaper parts (and no hydraulic
    brakes), but 11-speed vs 10-speed on the Trek.
  - https://www.specialized.com/us/en/allez-elite/p/199474?color=322263-199474
- Diverge Elite ($2,000)
  - 46x30, 11-36T. 10-speed.
  - Aluminum frame and carbon fork.
  - Competes with Trek Trek FX 2, except (1) carbon fork, and (2) more
    speeds.
  - Or Checkpoint ALR 5, but fewer speeds over wider range.
  - https://www.specialized.com/us/en/diverge-elite-e5/p/199974?color=322134-199974
- Tarmac SL6 ($2,700)
  - All-carbon.
  - 50x34. 11-32T. 10-speed.
  - All Tiagra parts.
  - Trek Domane 5 uses Shimano 105 parts, has 11-speeds. The AL 5 is
    $2,100 and the SL 5 is $2,700, so this sits in the middle.
  - Sport version ($3,500) is 11-30T 11-speed, all Shimano 105.

- Roubaix Sport ($3,500)
  - All-carbon.
  - 50x34. 11-34T. 11-speed.
  - All Shimano 105.
  - Here is your Trek Domane SL 5 competitor. $200 more expensive
    though.
  - https://www.specialized.com/us/en/roubaix-sport/p/199910?color=321716-199910

## 2025-01-XX Thoughts

- Mostly I think I want disc brakes. I really like those on Anastassia's
  bike.
- My current bike is 29.5 to 90.3 gear inches (1.10 to 3.38 ratio).
  Mostly I want lower gearing for ease of going up very steep hills.
  - Each gear is about 15% harder than the last.
- I think an aluminum frame is fine with me. I don't think that carbon
  makes sense. Expensive and fragile maybe.
- I don't think either drop or flat bars makes a big difference to me.
  The plus of flat bars is that I'm used to it. The pro of drop bars is
  that I'd enjoy trying that position of my body.
- I need mounting points for a rack.
- Wireless shifting is not interesting to me. I don't want to pay for
  it.
- I'm ambivalent about tire size. I probably would enjoy wider tires,
  which also probably brake a lot better. I have 25mm tires but I think
  Anastassia has 35mm and those seem awfully nice to me.
- A **1x12 40T 11-44T** setup runs about 25.3 gear inches to 101 gear
  inches. That's about 15% easier and 12% faster than my Alfline 8.
  - A big advantage is you never change your front chainring. Simplicity
    like the Alfine 8 system. Not that big a change for me.
  - I think the gear range sounds like a nice expansion from the Alfine 8.
  - Everything about this setup sounds just a bit better than what I
    have. Wider range, and especially easier gearing, just one
    chainring...
  - With 12-speed you have about 12% step between gears, which is better
    than current ~15%. Almost as good as 10-11% for 2x10 setups.
  - The Trek FX Sport 6 is 1x12 40% 11-44T. $3k and Electronic shifting.
  - Trek Checkpoint ALR 5 is 1x12 40T 11-44T system too. $2.5k. Drop
    bars. Uses SRAM Apex equipment.
  - Other Treks are either 1x11 11-42T, or 1x10 11-48T.
- A 2x11 46x30 11-34T cogset gives 24.5 to 116 gear inches (I assume
  40mm tires). That's about 17% easier and 28% faster.
  - Small chainring runs 24.5 to 64.2 inches (10 gears because no cross
    chaining). That's 30% slower than my Alfine top gear. Which means
    I'd probably exceed the small chainring often.
  - Big chainring runs 42.7 to 116 gear inches. That's 44% faster than
    the Alfine 8 low gear. No way could I stay in the big ring all the
    time in the city.
  - I think the problem is that in order to get the lowest gearing, you
    force yourself to constantly change rings when biking on the flat
    stop-and-go. That might be _worse_ than the 50x34 setup.
  - About a 10-11% gap between successive gears.
- A 2x11 50x34 11-34T setup runs about 26.8 gear inches to 122 gear
  inches. That's about 10% easier and 35% faster.
  - I think I want at least 34T at the back, otherwise the lowest gear
    is 28.4 gear inches and only 5% easier than my Mission Bicycle.
  - The small chainring runs 26.8 to 70.0 gear inches (only 10 low gears
    because can't crosschain). That's 23% slower than my Alfine top
    gear.
  - The big chainring runs 44.6 to 122 ger inches (10 high gears because
    can't crosschain). That's 52% faster than my lowest Alfine gear. So
    I definitely don't think I could stay in the big ring all the time
    in the city.
  - You _might_ be able to stay in the low ring for most of city
    streets.
  - I doubt this is the best choice for me. I think a 46x30 has to make
    more sense.
  - Again, a 10-11% gap between successive gears.

## New Bike Models

- 1x12 46T 10-51T Canyon Roadlite 7. Shimano Deore.
  - They only do direct to consumer...
- 1x11 40T 11-42T Giant Revolt Advanced 1. Shimano Rival. $3k.
  - Valencia, American Cyclery, Mikes Bikes SF.
- 1x12 40T 10-45T Specialized Crux Comp. Shimano GRX 820. $3.2k. No rack
  mount point though.
  - Velocipede
- Couldn't find a Cannondale that made sense.
- Salsa Warbird C GRX 600 1x. 40T 11-42T. Claims to mount a rack with a
  15kg capacity. Salsa seems to have a number of 1x bikes.
  - Box Dog, American Cyclery, Mikes Bikes SF.
- Bianchi. Couldn't find any that made sense? Impulso Pro doesn't have
  rear rack option?
  - American Cyclery, Bike Connection
- Trek
  - Valencia, Trek SOMA, Velocipede, Avenue Cyclery
