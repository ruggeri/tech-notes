## Is an IGH best for me?

I have an internal gear hub bicycle. It's debatable whether that is the
best option for me. A derailleur gear system would offer a wider gear
ratio. For the hills in San Francisco, that would help a lot.

Derailleur systems are also a bit lighter.

Gear hubs require less maintenance, but I probably should be able to
handle typical derailleur maintenance. Gear hubs seem to be less
finnicky to setup than derailleur systems. But maintenance of the hub is
intimidating and should probably be done at the shop?

A gear hub also handles bad weather and dirt and grime better. But San
Francisco has no winter.

On the other hand, you can switch gears while stopped, which is a very
nice advantage as a commuter.

Hubs tend to be a little bit less efficient.

## Other Gearhub Options

Primarily, I would like to have lower gears, so I can climb hills a
little easier.

**Shimano Alfine 8**

- Costs ~$250.
- It is what I have.
- Lowest gear is 0.53:1.
- Limit on input ratio is 2.0:1.
  - Basically, if there is too much mechanical advantage going into the
    hub, you can hurt the little parts in there.
  - To limit the torque into the hub, Shimano doesn't want you using too
    small a rear sprocket (or too big a front sprocket).
  - This ratio is based on some assumptions about rider strength, but
    especially weight. They want to know what happens if you stand on
    the pedals.
  - Some people do seem to violate this minimum without harm.
  - The limit is documented as the "sprocket ratio" here:
    https://si.shimano.com/api/publish/storage/pdf/en/dm/SG0004/DM-SG0004-06-ENG.pdf
- This limits you to a lowest ratio of 1.06:1.
  - Assuming 700C wheels, you have a low of 28.2 gear inches.

**Shimano Alfine 11**

- Shimano makes an 11 speed Alfine gearhub.
- This has a higher gear-ratio range of 409%.
- It's lowest gear of 0.53:1 is the same as the Alfine 8.
- It does suggest a lowest limit of 1.8:1. So maybe you can get more
  torque from this than the Alfine 8.
  - Of course you'll get more high-end speed because there are three
    more, higher gears.

- It costs about $450.
- People don't seem to have a high opinion of this hub. It seems to give
  problems.

**Rohloff Speedhub**

- This is a popular choice.
  - I think especially for mountain bikers.
- But it costs ~$1.8k!
- It has 14 speeds.
- Has gear ratio range of 526%.
- Rohloff also wants a minimum input of 1.9:1.
  - Found here: https://www.rohloff.de/en/service/handbook/speedhub/technical-data
- Lowest ratio is 0.279:1.
  - That's about 50% lower than the Alfine hubs!
  - Thus, you can get much easier gears.
- You can see the range here: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/45655/gear-for-incline-internal-gear-hub
  - Note this comparison is with 26" wheels.
