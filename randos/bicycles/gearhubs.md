## Is an IGH best for me?

I have an internal gear hub bicycle. It's debatable whether that is the
best option for me. A derailleur gear system would offer a wider gear
ratio. For the hills in San Francisco, that would help a lot.

Derailleur systems are also a bit lighter.

Gear hubs require less maintenance, but I probably should be able to
handle typical derailleur maintenance. Gear hubs seem to be less
finnicky to setup than derailleur systems. But maintenance of the hub is
intimidating and should probably be done at the shop?

A gear hub also handles bad weather and dirt and grime better. But San
Francisco has no winter.

On the other hand, you can switch gears while stopped, which is a very
nice advantage as a commuter.

Hubs tend to be a little bit less efficient.

## Other Gearhub Options

Primarily, I would like to have lower gears, so I can climb hills a
little easier.

**Shimano Alfine 11**

- Shimano makes an 11 speed Alfine gearhub.
- This has a higher gear-ratio range of 409%.
- It's lowest gear of 0.53:1 is the same as the Alfine 8.
- It has the same 1.9:1 input limit. So, in theory, you shouldn't get
  more torque from this, but high end speed.
- It costs about $450.
- People don't seem to have a high opinion of this hub. It seems to give
  problems.

**Rohloff Speedhub**

- This is a popular choice.
- But it costs ~$1.8k!
- It has 14 speeds.
- Has gear ratio range of 526%.
- You can see the range here: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/45655/gear-for-incline-internal-gear-hub
  - Note this comparison is with 26" wheels.
