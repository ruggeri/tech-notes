## Degreasers

- First, multi-purpose cleaner used inside the household is likely not
  strong enough to do a good job degreasing bike parts.
  - By pH, multi-purpose cleaner is approximately neutral at 6-8.
  - I did buy some Simple Green just for cleaning my bike though.
- Heavy duty degreaser may be pH 11-13.
- Another question is whether the degreaser is water or solvent based.
  - Water based means that water is used as the solvent, but water is
    not a good solvent for oils. Thus, surfactants are added, which
    helps water dissolve the oil. Soap is basically a surfactant.
  - However, you need to do a fair amount of scrubbing to remove the
    grease.
  - Simple green is a common choice.
- You can also use other solvent-based degreaser.
  - Some people literally poor gasoline over parts.
  - You can use mineral spirits (also called white spirits, mineral
    turpentine, petroleum spirits, or solvent naptha). These are
    petroleum derived and are an alternative to plant-derived
    turpentine.
  - Acetone can also be used as a heavy-duty degreaser, but it can
    damage finishes on painted surfaces. On the other hand, it leaves no
    film behind.
  - Mineral spirits, acetone, turpentine, naptha, and toluene are all
    referred to generically as "paint thinner." They all can be used as
    a solvent for oil-based paints. Sheldon Brown notes that paint
    thinner is a classic solvent choice.
  - Petroleum solvents need to be disposed of properly, so you have to
    be careful with them.
- Isopropyl alcohol can also be used, but it appears to not be as
  strong a solvent. I think it is used in applications where it is
  desired not to leave any residue.
  - BTW, rubbing alcohol is just 70% concentrate isopropyl alcohol (in
    the US). Rubbing alcohol is diluted like this to make it
    easier/safer to use in the home.
  - Rubbing alcohol isn't always IPA. It can also be ethanol based.
  - In that case, the ethanol has been _denatured_. Denatured ethanol
    (so called in the US) is also called _methylated spirits_ (UK).
    Denatured just means that poison or bad tasting chemicals have been
    added so that the ethanol is not consumed. It is denatured for tax
    reasons usually.
    - In the UK, rubbing alcohol is 95% methylated spirit.
  - The name methylated spirit implies that _methanol_ was added.
    - Methanol has a boiling point close to ethanol so it is hard to
      remove.
    - Though sometimes different bitterants are used. IPA can be used.
      But the goal is always to make it undrinkable.
    - Often methylated spirit is dyed so that people can see it is
      dangerous to consume.
    - A common use is as a clean burning fuel.
  - Methanol ingestion can destroy the optic nerve.
  - In situations where ethanol is not available, denatured alcohol
    may be consumed. A technique during prohibition was to strain
    Sterno through cheesecloth (or sometimes a sock), and mix the
    methylated spirit with juice. This gives the name "sock wine" or
    "jungle juice" (from hobo jungle).
  - Ethanol (and denatured alcohol) is used as a solvent or as a fuel.
  - Note that sterno is a jellied denatured alcohol. It's used as a
    cooking fuel.
- Citrus-based solvents use limonene. They are not petroleum based.
  - "Agent Orange" is a common choice.
- People note that dish soap and a brush is all that you need to clean
  chains/cogs et cetera. But that the job can be easier with a degreaser
- Solvent Comparison
  - People say that acetone is a much better solvent than isopropyl
    alcohol. However, they note it's volatile so you have to act fast
    before it evaporates.
  - Acetone is also a better solvent than mineral spirits.
- Bleach
  - We might as well talk about it in the context of these other
    solvents/degreasers.
  - Bleach is primarily dissolved chlorine. It can disinfect and
    sterilize.
  - Bleaches also remove color. Many colored organic compounds react
    with bleach, turning them into colorless compounds.
  - There is also hydrogen peroxide based bleaches (like Oxyclean). They
    have less bleaching power but are easier on fabrics. It also kills
    bacteria.
  - None of this helps with _degreasing_, which is the problem with
    bicycles, of course.
  - Clorox is a brand of chlorine bleach. The 7th Generation bleach I
    have at home is peroxide based.
  - Ironically, Clorox wipes contain no bleach.

**Degreaser And Ball Bearings**

- I think you have to be careful spraying degreaser where grease has
  been packed.
- Most importantly: you don't want to spray degreaser onto your axle or
  hub bearings. They need the grease to rotate easily. The degreaser
  will take it away.
  - Probably with cartridge bearings this is less of a worry, since
    there are seals to protect them from water and dirt ingress.
  - But it might be more problematic with cup-and-cone style.
- Also, it just speaks to the general principle of: there's supposed to
  be grease in places. If dirt has entered, you can remove the dirt and
  grease, but you must subsequently replace.

## Options

- Common companies that people recommend:
  - Pedro's Oranj Peel or Pig Juice
  - Finish Line (various)
  - Park Tool CB-4 Bio Bike Chain Degreaser
  - Muc Off
  - WD-40 Bike Cleaner/Degreaser
  - White Lightning Clean Streak
  - Simple Green Bike Cleaner & Degreaser
  - 3D Orange Degreaser
- Note that most of these are citrus based. Finish Line makes both a
  citrus based, but also the Speed Degreaser I have from them is
  heptane, acetone, propane, ethanol...
  - The Speed Degreaser seems to do a pretty good job. It is
    conveniently pressurized, so you can spray down components with it
    and penetrate a fair bit.
  - But it would be interesting to try soaking in something. I have
    purchased some Finish Line Citrus Degreaser to try soaking a chain
    in.
  - If I don't like that, then I might try mineral spirits.
- Note that you can have either cans/jugs, or aerosol sprays. The sprays
  can be very effective, but I would always want to take the parts off
  my bike so that mess doesn't get everywhere.

## Chain Lubricants

- I have been using Tri-Flow Superior Lubricant as a chain grease.
  - This is a dry lube based on teflon.
  - I also recently purchased Squirt Clean Long Lasting Chain Lube,
    which is a dry, wax based lubricant. I haven't tried it yet though.
- Dry lube goes on wet, and then dries. It tends not to get dirty as
  fast.
  - You are supposed to wait 2-4hrs before riding after application.
    - Other people seem to think that's bullshit and you only need
      30min.
  - Tend to have a parafin wax or teflon base.
  - The dry lube will be washed away by wet.
  - Often recommended for summer riding.
  - Tends to require frequent application.
- Wet lube is better for wet conditions.
  - You don't have to wait for drying, so you can just ride away after
    application.
  - It's thick and sticky, and stays on the chain despite water
    splashing on it.
  - On the other hand, it attracts dust and grit.
  - Tends to need less frequent application.
- It appears that much more important than lubrication is cleanliness.
  Which tends to favor _dry_ lube.
- When applying, apply a drop per link. Then, wipe off excess by
  rotating chain backward through a rag.

## Grease vs Oil

- Grease is oil with a thickener added.
- Often there is a choice of using grease or oil. But the major problem
  with oil is that it will leak out.
- Thus, axles and bearings are lubricated with grease.
- My Alfine hub is lubricated with grease, though the Alfine 11 actually
  has you add oil. It can do this because it is like a self-contained
  gearbox.
- Grease is not only used for lubrication. It is also used to repel
  water and prevent oxidation. This is why it is frequently applied to
  threads.
- I have Park High Performance Grease. There are lots of kinds.
  - There are also anti-seize compounds, which are greases specifically
    meant for threads and to stop seizing. But a lot of people say
    regular grease is fine.
- A note that liquid lubricants are appropriate when you need
  _penetration_. That is important for bike chains, for instance. You
  want the lubricant to be able to penetrate and lubricate the
  pins/bushings.

## Removing Rust

- Some parts may get rusty over time.
- White vinegar is a common approach. It is mildly acidic, containing
  acetic acid. You spray or soak, then scrub. You can also use citric acid.
- Rust converters convert the rust into a more stable chemical. Then you
  paint over it. But it won't restore it to looking like new. The
  process is called _chelation_.
- Of course, you can use wire brushes to brush off rust.
- You have to be careful with acid because it can also react with the
  metal causing pitting.
