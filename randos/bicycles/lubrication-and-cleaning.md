## Degreasers

- First, multi-purpose cleaner used inside the household is likely not
  strong enough to do a good job degreasing bike parts.
  - By pH, multi-purpose cleaner is approximately neutral at 6-8.
- Heavy duty degreaser may be pH 11-13.
- Another question is whether the degreaser is water or solvent based.
  - Water based means that water is used as the solvent, but water is
    not a good solvent for oils. Thus, surfactants are added, which
    helps water dissolve the oil. Soap is basically a surfactant.
  - However, you need to do a fair amount of scrubbing to remove the
    grease.
  - Simple green is a common choice.
- You can also use other solvent-based degreaser.
  - Some people literally poor gasoline over parts.
  - You can use mineral spirits (also called white spirits, mineral
    turpentine, petroleum spirits, or solvent naptha). These are
    petroleum derived and are an alternative to plant-derived
    turpentine.
  - Acetone can also be used as a heavy-duty degreaser, but it can
    damage finishes on painted surfaces. On the other hand, it leaves no
    film behind.
  - Mineral spirits, acetone, turpentine, naptha, and toluene are all
    referred to generically as "paint thinner." They all can be used as
    a solvent for oil-based paints. Sheldon Brown notes that paint
    thinner is a classic solvent choice.
  - Petroleum solvents need to be disposed of properly, so you have to
    be careful with them.
- Isopropyl alcohol can also be used, but it appears to not be as
  strong a solvent. I think it is used in applications where it is
  desired not to leave any residue.
  - BTW, rubbing alcohol is just 70% concentrate isopropyl alcohol.
    Rubbing alcohol is diluted like this to make it easier/safer to use
    in the home.
  - Rubbing alcohol isn't always IPA. It can also be ethanol based.
  - In that case, the ethanol has been _denatured_. Denatured ethanol is
    also called _methylated spirits_. Denatured just means that poison
    or bad tasting chemicals have been added so that the ethanol is not
    consumed. It is denatured for tax reasons usually.
    - The name methylated spirit implies that _methanol_ was added.
    - Methanol ingestion can destroy the optic nerve.
    - In situations where ethanol is not available, denatured alcohol
      may be consumed. A technique during prohibition was to strain
      Sterno through cheesecloth (or sometimes a sock), and mix the
      methylated spirit with juice. This gives the name "sock wine" or
      "jungle juice" (from hobo jungle).
  - Ethanol (and denatured alcohol) is used as a solvent or as a fuel.
  - Note that sterno is a jellied denatured alcohol. It's used as a
    cooking fuel.
- Citrus-based solvents use limonene. They are not petroleum based.
  - "Agent Orange" is a common choice.
- People note that dish soap and a brush is all that you need to clean
  chains/cogs et cetera. But that the job can be easier with a degreaser

## Options

- Common companies that people recommend:
  - Pedro's Oranj Peel or Pig Juice
  - Finish Line (various)
  - Park Tool CB-4 Bio Bike Chain Degreaser
  - Muc Off
  - WD-40 Bike Cleaner/Degreaser
  - White Lightning Clean Streak
  - Simple Green Bike Cleaner & Degreaser
  - 3D Orange Degreaser
- Note that most of these are citrus based. Finish Line makes both a
  citrus based, but also the Speed Degreaser I have from them is
  heptane, acetone, propane, ethanol...
- Note that you can have either cans/jugs, or aerosol sprays. The sprays
  can be very effective, but I would always want to take the parts off
  my bike so that mess doesn't get everywhere.
