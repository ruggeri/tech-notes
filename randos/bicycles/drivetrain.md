# Drive Train Basics

- You've got the _pedals_.
- Pedals are attached to the _cranks_, the arms attached to the
  chainring.
- The cranks are attached to the _chainring_. On my bike there is one
  chainring, but there are often multiple on a multi-speed bike.
- Aside on definitions:
  - The distinction between sprocket and gear is based on use. Gears
    mesh with other gears. Sprockets mesh with a chain.
  - The disc with teeth is called a _cogwheel_. The teeth are called
    _cogs_. Thus both sprockets and gears are cogwheels.
  - People often just call a cogwheel a cog. Especially on the rear of
    the bike.
  - The word chainring is reserved for the front sprocket, even though
    of course there's a chain on the ring at the back, too.
- One shifter is going to shift between the chainrings. The other shifts
  between the rear cogs.
- The chainring is what drives the _chain_, which is in turn connected
  to the rear sprocket in a single-speed bike. I'll talk more about
  casettes and freewheels in a moment.
- When you have a single speed, the gear ratio is going to be determined
  by the ratio of (1) the number of front chainring teeth and (2) the
  number of rear sprocket teeth. Basically: the ratio in circumference
  (or, likewise, radius or diameter), of the two wheels.
  - The crank length also matters, since the same force applied to a
    longer crank exerts more torque.
- Of course, higher gear ratios will result in more work done per turn.
  Thus you will need more force to turn the cranks. Lower gears means
  work done per turn will drop, which means you can turn the cranks with
  less force.
- On the other hand, at low gear ratios, you will need to rotate the
  pedals rapidly simply to keep up with the rotation of the rear wheel.
  This rotation is effectively wasted work of you circling your legs
  around. Your legs can only do a maximum RPM, so your top speed is
  limited by low gear ratios.

# Coasting and Freewheel

- On single-speed, non-"fixed-gear" bicycles, you can _coast_. This is
  because of a _freewheel_.
- A freewheel is a bit like a ratchet. It consists of two nested wheels.
  The outer wheel is driven by the chain, and the inner rotates with the
  wheel of the bicycle.
- There is a ratcheting mechanism where, when the chain part is driven
  fast, it grabs the inner wheel and drags it forward.
- However, when the inner wheel is moving faster, it just slides (or
  clicks) past the outer wheel. It does not try to drag the chain wheel
  backward.
- This allows you to coast.
- How do "coaster" bikes (the ones where you turn the pedals backward to
  brake) work? I don't care.

# Axle and Hub

- The axle is what affixes to the frame. The axle does not rotate.
  - The axle is affixed via locknuts to the frame _dropouts_. These are
    the little holes/slots where the axle can be slid into place.
- The hub is where the spokes affix to. Also, the cogset is screwed or
  splined and locked to the hub. When the wheel spins, the hub spins.
  - Note that the cogset has to live between the wheel and the right
    dropout.
  - That's because the cogset is attached to the hub, which doesn't pass
    through the frame.
  - The axle is the only part that extends through the dropout.
- The axle passes through the hub.
- Again: the axle never spins, whereas the hub spins with the wheel.
- This is allowed by **ball bearings**.
- The bearings are packed into a cup, and then a cone is screwed in to
  hold them in place.
- The cup and cone are called _races_.
- As dirt enters the races, it can interfere with the rolling
  friction. Eventually, you can even crack and damage the races. In
  that case, they would need to be replaced.
- This is what happened to us at Burning Man once.

# Freewheel vs Freehub

- As we have already said, freewheel simply means overrunning clutch.
- But in bicycle terminology, it is a little more specific. In a
  freewheel system, the cogset incorporates the freewheel, and the
  cogset is screwed into the hub.
- After use, the cogset would get screwed on very very tight to the
  hub, making it hard to remove.
  - That's because the legs exerted significant torque to drive the
    cogset, rotating the hub, but also tightening the cogset onto the
    hub.
- In the newer freehub system, the freewheel is incorporated into the
  hub.
- More importantly, but somewhat incidentally, freehub systems are
  _splined_. The cogset (called a _casette_ in the freehub system), fits
  over little ridges on the freehub. It isn't screwed in.
  - This means casette installation and removal are both easy.
  - The casette is secured to the freehub using a final lock ring.
- The freehub design allows the bearings to be located closer to the
  dropouts. If the bearings are located farther from the dropouts, then
  there is a levered force trying to bend the axle. This appears to have
  been a problem on older bikes?
- The splined solution has over advantages: you can easily replace
  individual cogs. You can replace the casette without replacing the
  ratchet mechanism.
- Anyway, it's not vital to know the pros/cons of freewheels versus
  freehubs. Just be happy that newer bikes use freehubs, which are
  easier to work with.

**Some More Details**

- How can you tell a cassette from a freewheel easily? Look at the
  internal fitting. Spin the freewheel counterclockwise.
  - If the fitting spins, then it must be for a lockring that holds the
    cassette stack. It's part of the stack that is spinning around.
- If the fitting stays stationary, it's because it's screwed into the
  hub, which is not rotating. It's a tool fitting for you to be able to
  unscrew the entire freewheel from the hub.
- It appears that the Shimano 12 spline interface is typical.
- Park Tool makes various tools to remove various freewheels. However,
  it doesn't appear they make a tool for the Shimano 600 freewheel I had
  to deal with.
  - The FR-1.3 may be the most typical. It's for Shimano 12-spline
    freewheels with a 22.6mm diameter. However, you have to check; there
    are also smaller diameter 12-spline freewheels, and large ones too.
    - And of course, other competing interfaces (many using notches),
      though those are less common.
  - There is still a lock ring, with two pin holes, that holds the
    freewheel bearings in place. You can use a hammer and center punch
    to unscrew this.
  - After that, you can use a pipe wrench (or in my case, a vise-grip
    and a rubber mallet) to grip onto the freewheel body and unscrew it.
- I believe the thread pitch is the same for practically all freewheels
  (ISO standard).
- More speeds on the freewheel necessitate wider dimension between the
  dropouts.
  - Sheldon says 120mm was standard for 5 speed.
  - 126mm was standard for 6 speed.
  - They also would try to fit 6 speeds with 120mm dropouts by using a
    closer spacing of cogs (5mm instead of 5.5mm between cogs). This is
    called "Ultra Six".
  - 7- and 8-speed cogsets always used ultra spacing. They fit in 126mm
    and 130mm dropouts. They weren't called "Ultra", because this was
    just the standard.
    - Shimano distance between cogs has changed further over time. They
      kept 5mm for 7-speed. Went down to 4.8mm for 8 speed. 4.34mm for 9
      speed, and 3.95mm for 10-speed.
- Note, that you can still put a 5-speed cogset on 126mm dropouts. At
  some point 120mm had become obsolete, and they would be producing
  126mm dropout frames.
  - Then, they might still put 5-speed for reasons pertaining to the
    placement of the hub bearings close to the center of the wheel? Or
    something something dish?

- When installing a freewheel, note that pedaling will tend to tighten
  the freewheel on. Thus, you don't need to torque it up yourself.
  - You can use a chain whip like SR-2.3 to tighten the freewheel on. But
    you can also do this just by standing on the pedal with the chain
    on.
  - You _do_ need a chain whip to install or remove a cassette.

## A Little More About Hubs

- Shimano hubs continue to use cup-and-cone bearings. Inside the hub is
  a cup, and then a cone is screwed down to hold the bearings in place.
  - For this reason, plenty of people prefer hubs from other
    manufacturers. People seem to feel that Shimano hubs aren't at all
    sexy, but they do admit they are functionality and of good quality.
- This may require adjustment for the axle to rotate freely.
- For this adjustment, you'll need a cone wrench, which is very narrow
  and small and used for a relatively low torque application like
  adjusting the cone.
- You then tighten a lock nut against the cone, so that they can't move.
- Rear hubs typically need 9x 1/4" ball bearings per side.
  - It looks like Wheels Manufacturing is most popular for bearings. You
    typical want "Grade 25" bearings, which are accurate to 25
    millionths of an inch.

# Chain

- The distance between chain pins in standardized to 1/2 inch.
- Chains come in different widths between the plates. This is the
  _roller width_. It is _not_ inclusive of the chain plates.
  - 3/32" is the standard for derailleur bikes. If the roller width is
    not quoted, this is probably it.
  - 1/8" is typical for fixed-gear or single-speed bikes. It can also be
    used on hub gear bikes (though not mine!).
- The wider the roller width, the more heavy-duty the chain tends to be.
- However, with derailleur bikes you need to account also for the total
  width of the chain, inclusive of plates. That's because the chain
  needs to not rub the other cogs on a cogset.
- This total width can be measured in millimeters. Different
  manufacturers manufacturer chains with various different
  widths. There appears to be no standardization.
- Because the millimeter measurements vary, there is a semi-standard
  of chain "speed." This means how many rear cogs it is intended to
  accommodate.
  - If you have 6 cogs on the back, you want 6-speed chain. If you have
    7 cogs, you'll want 7-speed chain.
  - Often you can run chain one gauge narrower than intended without too
    much problem (maybe shifting is a little wonky).
- However, you have a problem with higher speed chains: they are
  thinner, and thus less durable.
- For my bike, I should use the lowest chain speed, because it will tend
  to be more durable.

## Master Links

- I should make a quick note about _master links_.
- The easiest way to close or break a chain is if you have a
  master link. This is a link that can be opened and taken apart.
- For 1/8" chain, master links are simple and use a clip mechanism.
- Master links are difficult to build narrow enough to work with
  derailleur gearing.
- But the SRAM Power Link and KMC Missing Link do.
  - KMC makes different links for 6/7/8-speed, 9-speed, 10-speed,
    11-speed and even 12-speed chain. The 12-speed link is not
    reusable, though.
  - SRAM makes PowerLink 8-speed, PowerLink 9-speed, PowerLock
    10-speed, PowerLock 11-speed, PowerLock 12-speed. Note that the
    PowerLock is not reusable.
- If you don't have a master link, you will need to use a chain tool
  to remove a rivet and break the chain. When done, you'll need to
  push the pin back through to complete the chain.
- I think it's recommended not to break the same pin twice.

## Gear Ratios

- Important reminder: lower gear ratio means greater magnification of
  the input force. That is: lower gear ratio means easier pedalling.
- The "granny" gear on a chainring is the _smallest_ one. This results
  in the lowest gear ratio. It means that a turn of the pedals results
  in the least turn of the rear wheels.
- That means that the force required to turn the rear wheel with
  constant resistance is least.
- Internal hub gears have a minimum _input_ gear ratio. This gear ratio
  is determined by the chainring and rear cog.
- The reason is that the internal hub gear can only handle so much
  torque. If you exceed this, you're going to tear the hub apart.
- The minimum input gear ratio is making some assumptions about the
  strength of the rider. In particular, their weight matters. How much
  force would be input (pre-magnification) if the cyclist stood on the
  pedals?
- It also matters what the _crank length_ is. Greater crank length means
  more torque applied to the chainring.
- So if you are lightweight, weak, or have very short cranks, you should
  be able to violate the minimum input ratio for the hub gear.
