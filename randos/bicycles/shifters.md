## Drop Handlebar Shifters

- In the old days, you had downtube shifters. These were attached at the
  downtube. They were continuous; you kept moving them until they found
  the next gear.
- You also have stem shifters. These are a fad from the 70s and 80s.
  They were at the stem (where the handlebars are mounted). They
  encouraged riding using the top of drop handlebars.
  - People liked using just the top of the drop bars because it was
    similar to flat bars, but they wanted to look cool like they used
    drop bars.
  - These shifters were aimed at your groin in an accident.
  - Also, you had poor control when your hands are close to the center
    of the bars.
- Bar-end shifters were at the tips of drop handlebars. They were the
  standard for drop bars until...
- "Brifters" or _brake shifters_. This system, called STI (System
  Total Integration) lets you used indexed shifting, applying a click
  at a 90deg angle to the drop brake levers. Today these are standard.

## Flat Handlebar Shifters

- Thumb shifters were the norm on flat handlebars. They started out as
  friction shifters, but then later were indexed.
- Twist grip shifters exist. They have to be indexed because you can't
  get good enough fine adjustment to lock into gear.
- And nowadays we have Shimano RapidFire trigger shifters, like on my
  bike. These are, of course, indexed.

## Friction Shifting

- The old way is called _friction shifting_. Here, you continuously
  move the shifter through its range.
- I believe they are called friction shifters, because they rely on
  there being enough friction at the shifter to prevent it from
  sliding out of position once you set it.
- A common problem is that there isn't enough friction, and the bike
  won't stay in the gear you select, and instead slips away.
  - Note: the force pulling the shifter out of position isn't in
    proportion to how hard you are peddling. It's that the derailleur
    wants to pull you into the higher gears where it can extend and take
    up slack.
- There is normally an adjustment screw which you can tighten up to
  prevent this.
  - It's actually normally a wingnut or D-ring. So you can tighten it as
    you ride!
  - People note that sometimes it becomes loose when downshifting,
    because you are turning the shifter as if to loosen the retaining
    wingnut/D-Ring.
- Of course, more friction means you need to apply more force to the
  shifter.

## Indexed Shifting

- Here, there are preset steps by which you move the shifter.
- In trigger styles, it pulls or releases the cable until it gets to
  the next position.
- The difficulty is, what if you don't pull just right so that the
  correct gear clicks into place? You can't make minute adjustments
  here.
- Thus, it's important that cable also be very accurate, since you
  cannot compensate for this. Thus SIS (Shimano Indexed System) cable
  was invented. Read more in my cables document...
