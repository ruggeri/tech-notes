A revolving line of credit is simple. It is like a credit-card. They set
an interest rate and a credit limit. You can draw money from the
account. You have to make minimum payments monthly.

The alternative is fixed-duration bonds.

One expects the revolver to have higher interest rates. One also expects
it to be with a lower credit limit, and used primarily to smooth income,
rather than to finance projects.
