- TIPS and floating rate bonds can provide some inflation protection.
    - However, people often criticize TIPS for undertracking true
      inflation.
- Buying a house can be a good hedge, because it should hold its
  value.
    - Plus the fixed rate mortgage interest payments will depreciate
      in value.
    - Also, in the short term people may want to push its price up.
    - And, more money flowing into the economy can push up asset
      prices generally.
- Stocks can be a good inflation hedge. In the short term, companies
  that cannot adjust their prices will be hurt by inflation. And
  inflation is not positive for the general economy, so stocks might
  underperform in the short term. But it's definitely better than cash.
- Gold
    - Long-term demand for gold is not changing, and it holds its
      value.
    - Though, for shorter durations, you can probably buy other
      durable goods.

On the other hand...

- Bonds, especially long-dated bonds, will be destroyed if inflation
  is expected to be high for a long time. If you sell them, people
  will only buy for well below par.
- Certificates of deposit will likewise be destroyed.
