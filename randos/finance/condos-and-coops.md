- An apartment is a unit of housing inside a building.
- In a _housing cooperative_, you own a share of a corporation that owns
  the building.
  - You have a right to occupy a unit, but you do not actually have
    ownership of it.
  - Historically cooperatives screened their members.
  - I believe that ultimately the building owns your unit. Thus a
    cooperative probably makes more sense for communities that want to
    select certain kinds of tenants (like artists, for example).
  - In NYC, it appears that NYS law did not envision/allow condominium
    ownership until the 60s.
  - Under a cooperative, the building mortgage is held by the
    corporation. This makes it easier for the cooperative to raise funds
    for capital improvements.
  - Many buildings became coops in the 80s when it became unprofitable
    to lease them as apartments.
- In a _condominium_, you own the unit itself, and share ownership of
  the common area.
  - The legal concept of condominium was imported to the US in the 60s
    via Puerto Rico.
  - It was facilitated by FHA allowing insurance of mortgages on
    condominium units.
  - In general, the concept of the condo appeals to retirees, since they
    can afford housing in a desirable location that is otherwise beyond
    economic reach. South Florida is a classic example.
- In the United States, apartment typically means a unit owned by the
  building owner and leased to a tenant.
- Though a condominium can be leased by its owner. So there is potential
  overlap in terminology.
- Both condominium and cooperative owners pay a monthly fee for upkeep
  of the building.

# Condo vs Coop

- With a condo, you don't own the land of the project, but the airspace
  within your unit. You also own in common with all other owners the
  common area.
- When you purchase a Co-op stock, you aren't actually purchasing land.
  You own stock in a cooperative. Along with the share, you own the
  right to occupy one of the units of the building. That is, you have a
  right to a lease.
- With a condo, you pay property tax on your portion, plus monthly fees.
- Generally, a condo will have few restrictions on who you can rent to.
  Also easier to buy and sell.
- Condos also tend to be easier to finance.
- There appears to be a trend from cooperatives to condos. Because condo
  buildings tend to be newer than coop buildings, they may have
  better/more modern amenities and services.
- When you are part of a cooperative, you have to pay them for building
  expenses and real estate tax.
- Generally speaking, cooperatives require the owner to reside in the
  unit and may prohibit subleasing.
- It is harder to get a loan for a coop. You typically get it directly
  from the cooperative as a personal loan.
- Also, there is commonly a "flip tax." You pay 2-3% to the coop when
  you sell the unit.
- Cooperatives can even reject a sale simply because they think the
  price is too low, and that a low sale price will reflect poorly on the
  building. Wow.
- It sounds like cooperatives geographically are more located in older
  cities, because by the time other cities started to gain density, the
  condo concept had been imported.
- In general, coops are common in NYC and seldom used elsewhere in the
  US.
- Coops might be more picky because they can have a mortgage on the
  property. So when you move in, you're also responsible for that
  mortgage.
- Because coops can be up in your business, that's one reason they often
  cost less.
- Technically you can be evicted from a coop!
- A couple other things: the coop can go bankrupt, in which case you
  have nothing. Also, someone mentioned a coop with some kind of right
  of first refusal where _they_ take control of the property and sell it
  for what they want to. That tied up their equity for a long time.
- In NYC condos can cost more because they are subject to a tax credit.
  That increases the value to the buyer.
- It sounds like coops _typically_ are more restrictive than condos, but
  that isn't necessarily always the case.
- It sounds like approval to transfer the shares can be denied for many
  reasons, often crazy.
- I've heard several people talk about coop _minimum_ prices that you're
  allowed to sell for. That sounds nuts.
- Heard several people talk about flip tax. Yes it does sound like
  typically you can sublease. But the sublease often must be approved by
  the coop and they will only permit a certain number of simultaneous
  subleases in the building.
- Number of people talk about the credit of the coop. Are they exposed
  to real estate risk if they rent part of the commercial space. Do they
  own the land, or is it a ground lease?
- I think you may have more flexibility to modify your _own_ unit in a
  condo, because it actually is yours! Some people have mentioned that
  in Manhattan, you better like the unit you're buying in a coop,
  because you might not be able to change it!
- People talk about how the rules can work for them, especially as they
  get older. Fewer transients, people respect quiet hours, don't smoke.
- The financial status of the coop seems to be very important. People
  warn about coops with ground leases.
- One person mentioned that when someone doesn't pay maintenance in a
  condo, it can be hard to force them to sell/pay their share. But a
  coop has much more power.
- BTW flip tax is normally just on the _profit_.
- I should note that condos cannot have a mortgage on the common
  property. It must be owned outright. This is a legal requirement.
  - With a coop, you might lose your equity if the coop goes bankrupt
    and is unable to pay its mortgage.
  - On the other hand, a condo building might have more problems raising
    money for repairs because it cannot get a mortgage, but must
    self-finance.
- When it comes to the necessity to finance repairs, you can see that it
  is desirable to own in common with others who have the financial means
  to keep up with maintenance.
  - Of course, in Miami collapse, you can see that people were fighting
    against paying for repairs.

# By Layout

- A "flat" technically means literally one story apartment. It is
  "flat."
- A loft means an industrial space that is repurposed.
- A duplex means two units attached to each other. Often one next to the
  other (typical of condos) or above each other (typical of apartments).
