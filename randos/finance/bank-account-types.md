## FDIC Insurance

FDIC insurance is *per bank*. You don't get more insurance by more kinds
of accounts. But you get more insurance by having accounts at more
banks! For instance, if I have $250k in Schwab checking and $250k in
Chase checking, all $500k is insured.

Caveat: if I have a $250k individual checking account and a $250k joint
checking account (say, with my spouse), then all $500k is insured. You
get $250k per *account type* per bank. Here "account type" means
individual, joint, etc, *not* checking, savings, etc.

## Checking Accounts

* Sometimes called a "transactional account."
* Used for debit card and check payments. Basically: your bills.
* You can do ATM withdrawals.
* Insured by FDIC up to $250k.
* I saw up to 3.09% interest rates at one bank (which?).
    * But that was only up to *$30k* of deposit. Anything over is like
      0.1% interest.
* 2.15% is best rate I saw for unlimited (at Simple)
    * But that was actually *not* really a checking account? Was it
      merely a *savings* account*.
    * I think it did allow instant (unlimited?) accounts within the
      bank.
* In previous times it used to be forbidden to pay interest on checking.
    * The ban was motivated by a feeling that bank run of Great
      Depression was caused by excessive interest rates paid by banks to
      get people to deposit money.
    * Feeling was that if competition was too much, banks started doing
      very speculative things.
    * For a long time interest rates were low so no one cared.
    * This is why banks used to give you a toaster for opening an
      account.
    * Then starting in the 70s banks started offering "NOW" accounts,
      which were basically a checking account but with some legal tweaks
      to allow paying interest.
    * Dodd-Frank repealed (2009) all regulation of interest paid on
      checking accounts.
* Often these accounts are *fee* supported, or even are loss-leaders.
    * Can't earn too much because of churn in deposits.

## Savings Account

* Insured by FDIC up to $250k.
* You can't write (any?) checks on the account.
* You can make 6 withdrawals/transfers per month.
  * I think *settlement* is instant? (though there is still delay for
    interbank transfers?)
* Basically: not meant for day-to-day expenses.
* You can take out cash from an ATM I believe.
    * Unlimited cash withdrawals?
* Best rate I saw was 2.30% (where?).
    * May often have minimum amounts to open.
    * $10k to open.
* Presumably because of less churn, can invest in longer term
  instruments.
    * The bank mostly buys CDs, government debt, high grade commercial
      paper.
    * Commercial paper is unsecured short term (<270 day) debt from a
      company.
      * Distinguished from a bond only by length of term I expect?
      * Not sure if there are other differences?
* For a long time, I think maximum bank interest rates were regulated.
    * These came off in the 80s.

## Money Market Deposit Account

* Designed to offer higher interest rates than savings accounts.
* Insured by FDIC up to $250k.
* Like savings accounts: limited to six transfers per month.
* Unlike savings accounts: you can write checks.
    * Still only up to six I think.
    * I think you can even have a debit card.
* Typically requires minimum deposits.
    * Also: rates often tiered by how much money is invested.

* Settlement:
    * With savings I think settlement of transfers is instant?
    * With money market accounts I think it is often same-day but not
      always immediate?
* In older days, I think money market accounts paid higher interest than
  savings accounts.
    * TODO: why? Were there restrictions on what/how much savings
      account funds could be invested in?
    * But today, if they can invest in the same things, maybe banks
      should charge *more* (pay less interest) because money market
      accounts give check writing ability (which costs money for banks
      to provide?).
* Best rate I saw was 2.15%.

## Certificates of Deposit

* Insured by FDIC up to $250k.
* CDs lock your money up for a fixed duration. Therefore they can invest
  in longer term debt, generate more returns, pay higher interest rates.
* CDs may cost the bank very little to manage, since you won't be
  withdrawing from the account regularly.
    * Really though how much could this cost?
* Obviously the highest return of all, but with limitation on when you
  can withdraw.
* Rates around 2.3%, 2.4%, as high as 2.6% on 3 year CDs.
    * To be clear, you are paid *interest*, not a return. Just like
      other bank account types we've discussed.
    * The bank generates that return probably by buying into money
      market *mutual funds* (below).

## Money Market Mutual Funds

* Money market mutual funds are *mutual funds*.
    * They work just like all mutual funds.
    * You buy shares in the fund, which is managed by managers.
    * The fund pays the managers fees.
* These funds invest for you in short term debt and commercial paper.
    * This is the "money market." As in: versus the "stock market."
* The fund wants to keep a net asset value (NAV) of $1 per share. It
  therefore pays a dividend of any profit daily.
* Generally very low risk because of the nature of the short-term debt
  investing.
    * But in theory you can *lose* money if the loans are bad. This is
      called *breaking the buck* and has only happened maybe three times
      in history?
    * That happened when some funds like ended the day at $0.97 NAV.
* Unlike other kinds of mutual funds, I believe they allow very fast
  redemption of funds.
* Brokerage firms (like Schwab) often use money market mutual funds to
  "sweep" leftover cash (from buying/selling stocks).
    * On the Schwab website, the money market fund *looks* a little like
      a checking account, but in reality you own shares.
* These funds are *not* insured by the FDIC.
* Because of the downside risk (and lack of insurance), you should
  receive a higher return than in even money market deposit accounts.
    * I believe banks use your money in MMDAs to buy into their own
      money market mutual funds.
    * I believe I've been told that retail banks make almost all their
      profit off the fees of the mutual fund.
* Historical note:
    * During the financial crisis, money market mutual funds freaked out
      and got out of commercial paper lending.
    * This drove up interest on commercial paper very sharply. More
      importantly (?), *volume* was a lot lower. Companies could have
      failed to make payroll.
    * Presumably to entice money market funds into the commercial paper
      market, the FDIC temporarily (for a year or so?) guaranteed $1 in
      NAV at market funds.

## Conclusion

It looks like, broadly speaking, all bank account types offer about the
same rate of return. They seem to be the remnants of financial
regulation. But possibly it makes sense for banks to offer these
products: if a savings account has redemption flexibility intermediate
between a checking account and a CD, banks could pay interest
intermediate between those.
