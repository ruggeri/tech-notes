A _eurodollar_ is a dollar that is deposited at a bank overseas
(whether in Europe or Japan or wherever). It has nothing to do with
the Euro currency.

Basically, if an overseas bank accepts US deposits, it doesn't have to
follow the same regulations as US banks. For instance, it's not a
member of the Federal Reserve, so it doesn't have to pay for FDIC
insurance.

Likewise, the government of France is not going to guarantee US dollar
deposits in a French bank.

Because there is possibly greater risk, Eurodollars can pay higher
return. (In fact, to be competitive, Eurodollars _must_ pay higher
return, because there is greater risk.)

Also, there may simply be demand for dollars overseas. If I am
building an apartment building in Kenya, banks might prefer to
denominate a loan in USD because they're worried about inflation of
Kenyan dollar.

Likewise, individuals overseas may want to have their money in USD
because they want to preserve the value of their currency (and pay
their their dollar denominated debts).

They say that historically the Eurodollar market started because the
Marshall Plan sent a bunch of USD into Europe.
