- Let us say you want to trade shares in a non-US company on a US stock
  exchange.
- First, for an American to buy shares in a foreign company at a foreign
  exchange, you may have to do cross-currency transactions, which can be
  inconvenient.
- Also, there can be all sorts of challenges in your relationship with
  the company. How will they remit you dividends?
- So instead, a depositary receipt is traded in US dollars at a US
  exchange.
- A US bank issues the ADRs, and corresponding shares are deposited at a
  foreign depositary bank. The holder of the ADR may demand the foreign
  share, but holding the ADR is typically more convenient.
