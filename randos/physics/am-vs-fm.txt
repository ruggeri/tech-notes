AM modulates the *amplitude* of the wave. Like the wave can be "loud"
or "soft".

FM modulates the *frequency* of the wave. That is: how fast it is
oscilating. You can modulate fast or slow.

Both techniques, when time-sliced, can be used to send binary data.

FM rejects noise better than AM typically. Why? I think the answer is
that noise tends to affect the amplitude more than the frequency.

But then my next question is again: why? Why does noise not affect the
frequency particularly? I feel like it makes sense why noise directly
affects AM. It's like someone else was talking, thus modulating the
signal.

But why doesn't it have the same affect on frequencies?

It is true that the "zero crossings" can be affected by added noise. But
I guess the idea is that this won't mess with the frequency spectrum
very much? Maybe it's because the derivative is greatest at the zero
crossings, thus the impact of additive noise is the least here? If the
demodulator doesn't care about anything other than zero crossings, then
at other points in the curve it doesn't matter? I don't know...

Here were some sources. But they didn't totally answer my questions...

## More Notes

With AM, it seems like you should be able to multiplex various signals
over the same EM medium by choosing different *carrier frequencies*.

On the other hand, the fourier transform will only find the amplitudes
properly if the amplitude is held constant within the window.

The link from SE does talk a little bit about the bandwidth needed for
an FM signal. But I didn't read it thoroughly yet...
