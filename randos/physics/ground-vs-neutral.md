A grounded plug has three connections:

1. Live
2. Neutral
3. Ground (also called Earth)

The ground is used for, for instance, grounding the case of an
electronic device. No significant voltage will develop on the case,
since any build up of charge would be sucked away to ground.

A GFCI switch (ground fault circuit interrupter) is installed in
bathroom outlets. It measures the current difference between live and
neutral. Above a certain leakage current, the switch will trip. This
trips the switch if current starts running through ground, or even just
through your body to ground (not through the ground connection).

Note that the breaker (or fuse) in the breaker box will switch if the
live current draw is excessive. However, the tolerated current draw is
far above what will be dangerous to a human.

Note that neutral and ground are both connected to the earth. The
voltage difference across the two plugs should be zero. So why not just
use neutral to "ground" the case?

The point of the ground wire is to give a path to ground from the case,
in case the case is energized by a loose connection. Imagine that you
used a wire attached to neutral to "ground" the case. Imagine then if
the neutral wire fails. This happens if the neutral fails anywhere in
the circuit. Now, if you touch the case, you represent the only path to
ground. You will be shocked by the case with the full 120V.
