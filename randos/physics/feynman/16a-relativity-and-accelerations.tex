\subsection{Relativity and Accelerations}

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Feynman notes a potential paradox. Imagine Alice and Bob. Bob
  flies away, and returns. He is younger than Alice now.

  \item But from Bob's perspective, wasn't \emph{Alice} the one who flew
  away? But she came back older. Doesn't this violate symmetry?

  \item The solution is simple. Bob cannot imagine that Alice flew away,
  because it was Bob who experienced accelerations. Even if he was born
  on the spaceship, Bob needs to undergo forces to turn back around to
  get to Alice. This breaks the symmetry and explains the difference.

  \item \TODO{I think it deserves further explanation why, due to the
  accelerations, Bob doesn't perceive Alice's clocks as running more
  slowly - in fact perceives them running faster.}
\end{enumerate}
