\subsection{Space Time}

\begin{enumerate}

  \item We may ask: isn't it weird that the Lorentzian transform turns
  out to be the ``right one?'' Why not the Galilean transformation? It
  feels obvious that this should be the right one.

  This relates to our understanding of space and time. I think it is
  Minkowski who introduced the concept of ``space-time.'' When you are
  working in this concept space, the Lorentzian transformation becomes
  the natural one. I think. I don't believe Feynman fully discusses this
  in this chapter yet.

  \item It is noted that if you treat $(x, y, z, ct)$ as a four vector
  (or even just $(x, ct)$ as space time with one space dimension), you
  should find that $(x', ct')$ is simply a rotation of the original
  coordinates. I checked this but don't bother to repeat the math here.

\end{enumerate}
