\subsection{TODOs}

\begin{enumerate}

  \item \TODO{Prove using derivatives/calculus how mass must vary with
  velocity. I think there must be a more straightforward way than
  Feynman has done.}

  \item \TODO{Prove using derivatives/calculus the mass-energy
  equivalence. Feynman considered a gas and an approximation using the
  binomial theorem. Can we do something exact?}

  \item \TODO{Is rest mass real? Or is it just energy? Is potential
  energy real? Or is it just kinetic energy?}

\end{enumerate}
