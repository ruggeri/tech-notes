\section{Vectors}

\begin{enumerate}

  \item He shows that if forces are invariant under
  translation/rotation, then acceleration is also. This is a simple
  mathematical fact.

  \item He doesn't show that forces like gravity are equal under
  translation/rotation, but that would be easy to show.

  \item He then introduces vector notation.

  \item He explains how derivatives generalize to vector valued
  functions. I don't think he ever calculates a gradient, though. He's
  only using derivatives are only wrt time so far?

  \item He explains what the norm is.

  \item He explains the dot product.

\end{enumerate}
