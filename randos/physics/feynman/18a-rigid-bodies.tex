\subsection{Rigid Bodies}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Let us consider a \define{rigid body}: one where the parts have
  a fixed and unvarying distance form each other.

  \item We know that translating all points in the object does not
  deform it. We also know that rotation about an axis does not deform
  the object.

  \item Mirroring is also an isometry preserving transformation, but it
  is not possible to continuously perform on a rigid body. So we are
  restricted to roto-translations.
\end{enumerate}
