## Introduction

You had wind power, that ran mills and pumps. You had water power, which
also ran mills. Water sawmills also powered saws using a crank and
connecting rod.

You also had steam engines. These could either go through a series of
expansions chambers which drove pistons which rotated a rod. This was
typical of locomotives and early steamships.

You have internal combustion engines. I believe these have pretty good
efficiency. They also have the advantage of fast-start (steam engines
need to boil water). And you don't need to carry water to replenish lost
steam.

Steamships eventually switched to turbines. You can even have
turbo-electric, where turbine is used to produce electricity, which runs
an electric motor which turns the screws. I believe diesel engines have
better fuel efficiency, and maybe are smaller (have less weight), too.

Anyway, I want to discuss how to transform motion into electrical power.

## Magneto

If you have a coil of wire rotating in a fixed magnetic field, an
alternating current will be induced in the wire. For instance, by hydro
power, a **rotor** may be rotated. If the rotor contains a wire, then by
its rotation through a stationary magnetic field (**stator**), a current
will be induced.

(I believe most magnetos have stationary permanent magnets, while most
alternators tend to have rotating magnetic field coils).

A hand-cranked generator that works in this way is called a **magneto**.
A magneto is a kind of **alternator** (device for transforming rotation
into alternating current). However, when one says **alternator**, they
typically mean a device that uses _self-excitation_ to induce the
magnetic field (more on this later).

A major deficiency of the magneto is that the magnetic field is fixed
and cannot vary. Also, I think that magnets cannot generate that much
magnetic flux (that is, the strength of the magnetic field is low).
Thus, they are not useful for high-power applications.

On the other hand, magnetos are commonly used with bicycles. They are
incorrectly called _bicycle dynamos_ in this application. These either
are incorporated at the wheel hub, or make contact with a groved track
in the tire (bottle dynamo).

Sometimes magnetos are used as an ignition system for an internal
combustion engine. This would be the case if for weight or simplicity
reasons you did not want a battery ignition.

## Alternator

An **alternator** is any kind of device used to convert rotational
motion into alternating current. As we've seen, a magneto is a kind of
alternator.

However, when people say "alternator" they normally mean that the
magnetic field is provided by **field coils**, rather than a permanent
magnet. Recall that a coil of wire, through which current is flowing,
will produce a magnetic field. A coil used to produce a magnetic field
is called a **field coil**.

One advantage of the field coil is that you can vary the magnetic field
(by varying the field current). This will result in different voltage
output of the generator.

Question: since we want the alternator to produce electrical voltage
(current), how will we get the electrical current needed to run the
field coil? This is a kind of bootstrapping problem.

One answer is to use some kind of DC generator to run the field coils.
Note that you want something like a constant current through the field
coils to provide a constant flux magnetic field. This DC generator would
presumably be based on permanent magnets, or else we will not have
solved the problem.

The other approach is **self-excitation**. ("Excitation" just means
generation of a magnetic field through electrical current). We will use
some of the current generated by the rotor to feed the field coils. As
current begins to flow through the field coils, the magnetic field will
build up. More voltage will be generated, which can further drive the
field coils. Eventually, we connect the load to the generator, which can
now power both the load and the field coils.

It appears that you will want to perform some kind of _rectification_
before running the AC output through the field coils. Else, current
through the field coils will reverse.
