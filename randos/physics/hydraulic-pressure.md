- Say you have a hose. You place a thumb over the opening. The distance
  the water shoots out goes up. Why?
- The water is exiting the hose at a faster rate than before. Thus it
  covers more distance before it hits the ground. Why?
- The first thing to note is that water is _incompressible_. That means
  the mass of water travelling per second through any two parallel
  cross-sections of a pipe are always the same. There cannot anywhere be
  a buildup of water.
- If the water through the unconstricted part of the pipe travels at a
  constant rate before and after the intervention (constriction at an
  end), then the water passing through the constriction must at a faster
  rate. If exit velocity stayed the same, mass would build up
  pre-constriction.
- Of course, there is another natural possibility: exit velocity remains
  constant. In that case, velocity through the unconstricted section
  must slow down.
- The rule about cross-sectional areas is not enough to tell us what
  happens.
- An important factor is this: if the water travels at a slower rate
  through the unconstricted portion, friction in that part of the pipe
  will be less. That means less energy will be expended in that part of
  the pipe.
- The water has capacity to do work as it flows through the pipe. Before
  the intervention, all of the work was spent in friction, as well as
  the terminal velocity of the water.
- Now, if the water starts to move more slowly through the unconstricted
  pipe, there is a corresponding decrease in energy spent on friction.
  This extra energy is available to increase the velocity of the water
  exiting in the final stage.
- On the other hand, we know that the velocity in the unconstricted
  portion could not have simply remained constant. For then then the
  same energy would have been expended in friction. There would be no
  leftover energy available to accelerate the water in the final,
  constricted stage.
- Thus covering a hose will tend to speed up the exiting water velocity
  (meters per second). It will also tend to reduce the flow rate in
  liters per second.
- The exact relationship depends on the friction in the pipe.
  - I think the higher the friction in the pipe, the more a constriction
    will speed up the exiting water. This is because a small decrease in
    velocity frees up a large amount of energy for the water to flow
    faster.
  - In a frictionless pipe, with no turbulence (or even rotational flow
    of the liquid, where energy can be stored), I think that there would
    be no effect in covering an end.
  - But the frictionless case is actually perverse. The speed of the
    water is different at different heights of the pipe, even though the
    cross-sectional area is assumed the same. That violates one of our
    assumptions about flow.
- I think the general idea here is about **Bernoulli's principle**,
  which I could study more.
