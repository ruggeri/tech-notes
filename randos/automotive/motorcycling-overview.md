## Singles

- All these bikes make <50HP and <30ft-lb.
- BMW (G310R) and KTM (R390 and 390 Duke) both make 300-400cc singles.
  They make 35-45HP and 20-30ft-lbs. They do this presumably because
  they don't make small twins (their smallest twins are middleweights of
  ~890cc).
- Royal Enfield makes a couple 350-400cc singles. Again, they make only
  middleweight twins, and a single is probably really cheap for them.
- Honda makes the CB300R and CBR300R. I think this is part of their
  strategy of making a somewhat bigger twin (500c), rather than compete
  with the 400cc bikes from Kawasaki.
- The standout bike in this class is the KLR650, which is a 650cc dual
  sport. It makes the most torque at 33.5ft-lb @ 4.6k. That makes a lot
  of sense for a small dual sport bike.

## Twins

- Aprilia
  - Inline twins, 270deg crank, 660cc. Makes about 90HP @ 10.5k, 45ft-lb
    @ 8.5k. RS (racing/fared), Tuono (naked), Taureg (adv).
    - I think I'm excited for something with more torque.
    - I think Aprilia can make these numbers at this displacement in
      part because the engine revs high (10.5k), and because it has a
      high compression ratio (13.5).
- BMW
  - Boxer twins, 1250cc. 135HP @ 7.75k, 100ft-lb @ 6.25k. Most popular
    is **1250GS** (adv), but also have naked (1250 R), sport touring
    (1250RS), and touring (1250 RT).
    - I'd consider a 1250GS.
  - Inline twin, 270deg crank, 850-900cc. ~90-100HP @ 8.5k, ~65ft-lb @
    6.5k. A few models of this type; F750GS, F850GS, F900R (naked),
    **F900XR** (standard).
    - Have a high compression ratio of 13.1, are about 40% bigger than a
      650cc.
    - These don't feel like they have enough character to truly interest
      me? Maybe the F900XR is a good upgrade from the Ninja 650?
- Ducati
  - V-Twins (90deg). 950cc. 110HP @ 9k, ~70ft-lb @ 6.5k. Monster
    (naked), SuperSport 950 (more like a standard), Multistrada V2
    (tourer).
    - The **Multistrada V2** is probably a pretty reasonable option,
      though not super fun. The Supsersport 950 looks great, but is
      probably not as practical.
  - Also has Panigale V2 (sport) and Streetfighter V2 (naked) that does
    155HP @ 10.8k, ~70lb-ft @ 9k. ~20% RPM than SuperSport. Compression
    is the same. Has a higher bore-to-stroke ratio (1.64 vs 1.4); maybe
    that helps the bike breathe at high RPM? Looks like it makes its
    torque higher.
- Honda
  - Inline twins, mostly 180deg crank, about 500cc. Make about 50HP @
    8.3k and 30lb-ft @ 6.5k.
    - Tend to use low compression, don't rev that high.
    - Glad I didn't start out with any of these. Not a lot of bike. Too
      small to be interesting.
  - **Africa Twin** (adv) is ~1100cc, 270deg crank, 101HP @ 7.6k,
    77ft-lb @ 6.3k.
- Kawasaki
  - Inline twins, 180deg crank. 400cc machines make 45HP @ 10k and
    28ft-lb @ 8.2k. 650cc makes 70HP @ 8k and 45ft-lb @ 6.6k.
  - Weird exception was W800 360deg twin retro. This had low
    compression, low torque, low HP. Air cooled!
- KTM
  - Inline twin, 890cc, 255deg crank. Makes about 100HP @ 9.5k and
    75ft-lb @ 7k. Similar to BMW and Ducati's twins of similar
    displacement.
  - V-twin, 1300cc, 75deg V-angle. About 140HP @ 10.1k and 100ft-lb @
    8.3k. This is very similar to BMW's boxer twins of similar
    displacement.
    - Interestingly, the KTM makes power and torque much higher than BMW
      1250 GS. But it doesn't make more power? And it has the same
      displacement? Is it just inefficient?
- Moto Guzzi
  - 90deg V-Twin, 850cc. Makes 64HP @ 6.8k and 55lb-ft @ 5k. Pretty low
    compression and low RPM. Torquier than the Ninja 650. Less power and
    torque than BMW and Ducati 850-950cc bikes, but makes torque a bit
    lower?
- Royal Enfield
  - Inline twin, 270deg. 650cc. 47HP @ 7.2k, 38lb-ft @ 5.3k. These make
    very low HP and very low torque. Compression ratio is quite low at
    9.5.
- Suzuki
  - V-Twin 1050cc, 90deg. On V-Strom 1050. 95HP @ 8.7k and 65lb-ft @
    4.6k. Not as powerful as BMW's bigger boxer. Ducati's 950cc V-Twin
    makes more power and torque (albeit at higher RPM), they also use
    higher compression. Competes most directly with Honda's Africa Twin.
  - V-Twin 650cc, 90deg. Used for SV650 (naked) and V-Strom 650 (adv).
    75HP @ 8.9k and 43lb-ft @ 8.2k. Comparable to Ninja 650.
  - Inline twin, 180deg, 250cc. Only used in GSX250R. Makes 25HP,
    17ft-lb.
- Triumph
  - Inline twins, 270deg. 1200cc make ~100HP @ 7.3k and 83lb-ft @ 4.3k.
    The 1250GS makes peak torque later, but has more torque even at 4k.
  - 900cc makes 60 HP @ 6.9k, 55lb-ft @ 3.7k. Feels most similar to Moto
    Guzzi V7 I guess.
- Yamaha
  - Inline twins, 270deg. A few 320cc engines 36HP 20ft-lb.
  - Next is 700cc engines making 70HP @ 8.8k and 50ft-lb @ 6.6k. Very
    similar to Ninja 650. YZF-R7 (race), Tenere 700 (adv), XSR700
    (street/retro/standard), MT-07 (naked).
  - Last is a 1200cc, which they use only in the Super Tenere. Makes
    110HP @ 8.9k and 87ft-lb @ 6.6k. Similar to Africa Twin, but bigger.
    Less power than 1250GS, maybe because that uses higher compression
    (12.5 vs 11).

**Summary**

- Tiny bikes: 500cc and smaller.
  - Honda (500s), Kawasaki (400s), Yamaha (300s), Suzuki (only one: a
    250cc model).
  - European brands don't seem to bother.
  - All make <50HP and <30ft-lb.
  - Configured in different styles (pseudo-sport, naked, pseudo-adv),
    but I think more for affectation of style and less for capability.
  - All have 180deg cranks (probably simply because this is a low-end
    market).
  - Some people really like these bikes because they're small and agile
    and fun to race.
  - But none of these bikes have enough grunt for me to be interested in
    them at this point.
- Medium bikes: about 650cc.
  - Mostly about ~70HP, ~50ft-lb.
    - Except Aprilia, which revs high and makes ~100HP.
  - More variety. Kawasaki and Yamaha are the most dedicated with a full
    lineup of naked, adv, and sport(ish) bikes. Yamaha also offers a
    retro-ish XSR700. The two powerplants make very similar power/torque
    ~70HP @ ~8k and ~50ft-lb @ ~6.5k.
  - Yamaha has a bit of an edge because bigger (689cc vs 650cc) and
    slightly higher compression (11.5 vs 10.8). Also, Yamaha does 270deg
    cranks instead of Kawasaki's 180deg.
  - Suzuki offers naked and adv versions of its 650 V-twin. Makes power
    and torque commensurate with Kawasaki and Yamaha.
  - Honda only offers NC750X; I think they concentrate on fours. The
    NC750X has more torque, and lower, than the Yamaha or Kawasakis. It
    makes less HP (51HP), because it revs much lower. Bore/stroke seems
    much longer, which may explain more grunt at low RPM. Also, it has
    higher displacement. Maybe rev (and thus HP) limited because fuel
    economy?
  - Aprilia offers a range of bikes: adv, sport, standard. They make
    similar torque to the Kawasaki and Yamaha bikes (~45ft-lb @ 8.5k),
    but rev quite a bit higher and make more HP (~95HP @ 10.5k). The
    Aprilia has a wide power-band, but it doesn't overtake the Ninja 650
    torque until 6k RPM; the Aprilia does hold torque a lot longer. The
    Aprilia use a lot higher compression (13.5 vs ~11).
  - Royal Enfield makes low compression 650 inline twins. They make less
    than 50HP and 40ft-lb, though they do produce it a bit lower in the
    rev range.
  - Kawasaki also makes the weird, 360deg inline twin 800cc W800. This
    is a retro bike, referencing English bikes I guess. Air cooled.
    Compression, torque and HP are all very low.
  - Besides Aprilia, European brands like BMW, Ducati, and Triumph don't
    bother here.
  - In conclusion: the Aprilia is the most interesting bike in this
    class. It hardly gives up anything in low-end torque vs the Kawasaki
    or Yamaha bikes. But it makes more HP just by reving higher, and
    that probably isn't super interesting to me.
- Large bikes: about 900cc.
  - Japan does not build twins of this size. Only Europeans like BMW,
    Ducati, KTM, and Triumph.
  - BMW offers some ADV (850GS), standard (**F900XR**), and naked
    (F900R) bikes ~850-900cc. Make about 85HP @ 8.5k, 55ft-lb @ 4.25k.
    They are 270deg cranks.
    - The Aprilia 660s rev higher and make about +10% more power! But
      they don't make nearly as much torque, especially down low.
    - F900XR is 480lbs, vs 400lbs for the Tuono 660. And wheelbase is
      longer.
  - Ducati makes 950cc V-twins. They make 98 HP @ 9.4k and 61ft-lb @
    6.25k. This is basically similar to the BMWs, which have similar
    displacement and compression. They sell it in SuperSport (sport),
    Monster (naked/standard), and **Multistrada V2** (adv/tourer)
    versions.
  - KTM makes 890cc inline twins with 75deg crank offset. It makes power
    (106HP @ 9.4k) and torque (63ft-lb @ 8.4k) similar to the Ducati.
    The ADV and Duke (naked) bikes seemed maybe tuned differently. But
    both seem to make more torque and lower than the BMW.
    - They may have downsized this bike to a 790cc recently...
  - The Ducatis and the KTMs feel very similar. The BMWs feel weaker;
    they don't rev as high, but they don't make more power low either.
    The Ducati and KTM torque comes in at 4k, and just continues from
    there.
    - The Ducatis and KTMs offer +50% HP (100HP vs 65HP) and +40% torque
      (61ft-lb vs 45ft-lb) over the Ninja 650.. They have about equal HP
      to the Tuono 660, but +35% torque.
    - The BMW is only +35% HP (88HP vs 65HP) and +30% torque (58ft-lb vs
      45ft-lb) over the Ninja 650. That's not very compelling.
    - This tracks with a +40% increase in displacement.
  - Triumph makes its smallest classics like the T100. They do about
    60-65HP @ ~7k, and about 60ft-lb @ ~3.75k. That has no more HP than
    the Japanese 650s, but makes +33% more torque quite a bit lower. It
    makes torque just a touch lower than the BMW 900s, but those use
    higher compression than the Triumphs (13.1 vs 11.0).
    - I think the difference from the Ninja is due to using a squarer
      engine: the stroke is longer, while bore is held constant. So the
      engine can't breathe better at high RPM.
    - **TODO**: review bore-vs-stroke.
    - Not compelling enough a torque upgrade, especially with no more
      power than a 650 on offer.
  - Moto Guzzi makes the 853cc 90deg V-Twin. This makes only ~65HP @
    6.8k (similar to Ninja 650), but ~55lb-ft @ 5k. Feels very similar
    to the Triumphs.
  - Overall, I feel like this class, while offering more HP and more
    torque, isn't really a big enough upgrade to be worth it over the
    650s.
  - The class defying bike is the Ducati Panigale V2. It makes 155HP and
    77lb-ft.
    - Looks like it has much higher bore-to-stroke, which probably helps
      it breathe at high RPM. And this revs to 10.75k, vs 9k for a
      Multistrada.
    - The 155HP number is claimed, not from a dyno. So I don't trust it
      entirely. I also don't trust the torque number entirely.
    - Sounds like a hell of a bike to race?
- Huge bikes: above 1000cc.
  - BMW uses its 1250cc boxer twin in adv, naked, sport touring, and
    touring bikes. They all make ~120HP @ 7.7k, and 91lb-ft at 6.5k.
    That's about +40% HP and +65% torque than their 900cc offerings.
    It's about +100% HP and +75-80% torque over the Ninja 650.
  - Triumph makes the Speed Twin, which makes ~90HP @ 7.2k and ~80lb-ft
    @ 4.2k. That is a fair bit less power/torque than the BMW. I'm not
    exactly sure why. The BMW has slightly more compression than the
    Speed Twin.
    - Still, this is +38% more HP and +58% more torque than a Ninja 650.
  - Japan makes ADV bikes in this class: Yamaha Super Tenere, Honda
    Africa Twin, Suzuki V-Strom. It feels like the Africa Twin makes
    significantly more torque than the V-Strom; I'm not sure why, as
    they have similar displacement, and the V-Strom has more
    compression. I can't find a good dyno for the Super Tenere. The
    Africa Twin's 96 HP @ 6.7k and 78 ft-lb @ 5.9k are quite similar to
    the Speed Twin.
  - The real exception in this category is the 1290 Super Duke, which
    makes 160 HP @ 10.1k and 93 ft-lb @ 8.3k (+140% and +110% vs Ninja
    650). It achieves this with high compression (13.6) and revving very
    high.
    - That said, the BMW makes more torque much lower; the KTM doesn't
      really make more power until past 7k.
    - Then again, the KTM weighs about 20% less.
