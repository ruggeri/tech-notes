- Electric motors
  - Induction vs synchronous motors. Why does torque eventually fall?

    - TODO: review this again. It is mostly about valve timing.
    - A very useful source.
    - Says that touring bikes have no valve overlap. That basically means
      that they aren't open long enough to let enough air in at high revs.
    - Says that longer valve timings are better for higher RPM bikes so
      that they have more opportunity to fill up with air.
    - What happens when intake valve is open during compression? At low
      RPM, this is bad. Some fuel is pumped back out by compression. That
      lowers total fuel for ignition, and thus lowers torque.
      - But at high RPM, there is actually substantial intake velocity.
        That creates momentum into the cylinder even despite the rising
        piston.
    - Thus, if tuned this way, engines designed to rev at high RPM can
      produce their most torque at highest RPM, which is how you maximize
      horsepower.
    - This is why variable valve timing is an exciting technology.
      - They can get more torque out of low end without sacrificing so
        much at high end.
