  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_ratio
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_ratio
    - Note that compression ratio doesn't increase power because there's
      more air and thus you can burn more fuel. Compression ratio isn't
      about shoving more air into the cylinder like turbo and
      supercharging.
    - It's that the peak temperature is higher, so more work is done on
      expansion stroke. And the stroke is effectively longer. You can
      imagine an engine with a _zero_ compression ratio; it obviously
      doesn't do any work.
    - I think that compression means that you get more work out of the
      same fuel/air drawn into the cylinder. It's more _efficient_. But
      it also makes better power because each combustion cycle makes
      more work.
    - You do have to do more negative work on the compression stroke.
      But this is offset by more positive work on combustion stroke.
    - Limits to compression include knock, but also as you compress gas
      further you start to lose heat to cylinder walls, which eventually
      means _worse_ efficiency. You also have higher pressures which
      means more stress. But in ideal Otto cycle yes higher compression
      is always better.
    - Efficiency of Otto cycle is `1 - 1/(compression_ratio ^ (gamma-1))`, where gamma is the adiabatic index.
    - The point being, effect of increasing compression ratio eventually
      decreases.
    - Since compression is good for power and good for efficiency, why
      do bikes run low compression? Because longevity of engine,
      availability/price of low octane fuel, and also because I think
      high CR means that while mpg might be better (and thus lower CO2
      emission), NOx emission might be _worse_. Which means running
      higher compression might mean bigger catalytic converters.
