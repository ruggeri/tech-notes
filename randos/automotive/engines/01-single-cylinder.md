## Single (AKA Thumper)

- Simpler than multi-piston engines.
- And lower cost!
- Smaller displacement, usually less power, but also lower weight, and
  smaller volume.
  - All singles on my motorcycle list make less than 50hp.
- You can increase RPM to increase power, but that tends to wear the
  engine out faster.
  - If you do higher RPMs, you need stronger connecting rods, for
    instance. Because the pistons are trying to tear them apart.
  - KTM makes a thumper that does 77hp. But that's not enough for most
    people on the highway.
- Can sometimes get away with air cooling because air isn't blocked
  from any of the cylinders.
- They have pulsing power delivery and a lot of vibration.
  - This is because the engine is not _balanced_. We'll talk more
    about that later.
- To even out power pulsation, they'll use a larger than typical
  _flywheel_. The flywheel stores power as rotational inertia.
  - A heavy flywheel increases rotational inertia and makes changes in
    revs slower.
- You can use a counterweight to try to balance the engine. But this
  won't be perfect, because a counterweight spins with the crankshaft,
  and its motion is thus not perfectly opposed to the piston motion.
  - If you use a counterweight that balances 100% of the vertical net
    force, then at 90deg, there will be a net force horizontally.
  - You've just rotated the plane in which the force acts.
  - The best you can do (with a simple counterweight) is to reduce the
    magnitude of the shake by half and constantly rotate the direction
    of the shake.
- To even out vibration, you can start adding _balance shafts_ to
  counteract vibrations. But soon enough it will be easier to build a
  multi-cylinder engine.
- Single cylinder tends to be more fuel efficient. But is that just
  because it is lower power?
- At same displacement, will make more low-end torque than a twin?
  - I'm not sure this is necessarily true. However, we expect the twin
    to rev higher than the single. So we expect that valve timing will
    be optimized for higher revs on the twin.
  - Also, we expect the stroke of the single to be longer, and maybe
    that means more torque? Check the article on stroke-bore ratio...
- Some people don't like the sound, which has long gaps between
  combustion. Sounds like a lawnmower.
- Single cylinder can do well in dirt, because 75% of the time the tire
  is not under power, which means it has more time to recover traction.
- Because singles have a lot of vibration, they can't reach high RPMs,
  which is going to limit the power they can produce.
- Bikes using this are typically under 400cc and produce very low power.
  Normally entry level.
