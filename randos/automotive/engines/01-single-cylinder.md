## Single (AKA Thumper)

```
-   0deg - 180deg: Piston combustion  (power)
- 180deg - 360deg: Piston exhaust     (silence)
- 360deg - 540deg: Piston intake      (silence)
- 540deg - 720deg: Piston compression (silence)

# Note: 180deg of power followed by 540deg of silence.
# Note: No primary balance. No secondary balance.
```

- Simpler than multi-piston engines.
- And lower cost!
- Smaller displacement, usually less power, but also lower weight, and
  smaller volume.
  - All singles on my motorcycle list make less than 50hp.
- You can increase RPM to increase power, but that tends to wear the
  engine out faster.
  - If you do higher RPMs, you need stronger connecting rods, for
    instance. For the piston to change velocity/direction requires a
    force through the connecting rod. This basically tries to tear the
    rod apart.
  - KTM makes a thumper that does 77hp. But that's not enough for most
    people on the highway.
- Can sometimes get away with air cooling because air isn't blocked
  from any of the cylinders.
- They have pulsing power delivery and a lot of vibration because the
  engine is not balanced.
- To even out power pulsation, they'll use a larger than typical
  _flywheel_. The flywheel stores power as rotational inertia.
  - A heavy flywheel increases rotational inertia and makes changes in
    revs slower.
- You can use a counterweight to try to balance the engine. But this
  won't be perfect, because a counterweight spins with the crankshaft,
  and its motion is thus not perfectly opposed to the piston motion.
  - If you use a counterweight that balances 100% of the vertical net
    force, then at 90deg, there will be a net force horizontally.
  - You've just rotated the plane in which the force acts.
  - The best you can do (with a simple counterweight) is to reduce the
    magnitude of the shake by half and constantly rotate the direction
    of the shake.
- To even out vibration, you can start adding _balance shafts_ to
  counteract vibrations. But soon enough it will be easier to build a
  multi-cylinder engine.
- Single cylinder tends to be more fuel efficient. But is that just
  because it is lower power?
- At same displacement, will make more low-end torque than a twin?
  - I'm not sure this is necessarily true. However, we expect the twin
    to rev higher than the single. So we expect that valve timing will
    be optimized for higher revs on the twin, and lower revs on the
    single.
  - Since we don't need large valves to support high RPM, we may expect
    a longer stroke relative to the bore. Elsewhere I think we find that
    a smaller bore-to-stroke engine develops more torque and at lower
    RPM?
- Some people don't like the sound, which has long gaps between
  combustion. Sounds like a lawnmower, because this is what lawnmowers
  use.
- Single cylinder can do well in dirt, because 75% of the time the tire
  is not under power, which means it has more time to recover traction.
- Because singles have a lot of vibration, they can't reach high RPMs,
  which is going to limit the power they can produce.
- Bikes using this are typically under 400cc and produce very low power.
  Normally entry level. And especially dirt bikes.
