# We have two cylinder banks. The left and right banks are offset by 90deg.
# L1 and R1 will share a crankpin. L2 and R2 will share a crankpin.
# The crankpins are offset by 180deg.
# We will start with L1 firing and crank toward the right bank.

Production motorcycles (as of 2025):
# Aprilia RSV4: 65deg V4 with 180deg crank offset.
# Aprilia Tuono V4: 65deg V4 with 180deg crank offset.
# Ducati Multistrada V4 and Diavel V4: 1158cc, 90deg V4 with 70deg crank offset. Engine is named "Granturismo".
# Ducati Panigale V4 and Streetfighter V4: 1103cc, 90deg V4 with 70deg crank offset. Engine is named "Stradale".
# Ducati Panigale V4 R is 999cc because it's a World SBK homologation.

Homologations and discontinued bikes:
# Honda RC213V-S: 90deg V4 with 360deg crank offset. Sold only in limited numbers in 2015. Homologation of their race bike.
# Honda VFR800: 90deg V4 with 180deg crank offset. (Discontinued 2021)
# Honda VFR1200F discontinued 2017
# Yamaha V-MAX: 70deg V4, ??? crank offset? (Discontinued in 2020)
# KTM makes the RC16 for MotoGP but has never homologated or sold it.

# BTW, only I4 competitor in MotoGP is Yamaha. Kawi, Suzuki, and BMW don't compete in MotoGP.

- V4 and I4 bikes are obviously competing in MotoGP, and V4 tends to
  win. Advantages are more about chassis geometry of the bike, where the
  mass is, aero, cooling, and crank length. V4 is better in most of
  these regards, but more complicated, which is why I think Japan
  doesn't really bother anymore. Especially when you can't really sell
  too many V4 bikes.
  - 1L+ I4 makes similar max torque and power. Because V4 is shorter
    front-to-back, it can design better intake and airbox. I don't
    understand this, but it means the bike breathes better at low speed.
- The V4s are generally tuned for top-end power, but they will have
  broader torque than I4 600cc supersports. Simply because they have
  bigger displacement.
- And the Ducati Granturismo is especially tuned for lower redline
  (~10k), and broader torque.
- All the V4s seem to be making significant torque by 20-30mph
  (Multistrada ~10mph), whereas maybe an I4 supersport only starts
  making real power at 45mph.
  - Because (1) 1L+ V4s have more displacement than 600cc bikes, (2) I4
    supersports must have super aggressive tuning to make power, and
    that hurts torque curve breadth.
