- V12: Basically two I6s.
- I6s already have perfect primary and secondary balance. And so does
  the V12, which is basically two of them.
- I think just provides more even power delivery (because more
  cylinders). Also, smaller cylinders means can rev higher at same
  displacement. More power.
- This is the biggest engine typically used in cars.
- Supercars might have this engine. Very smooth and very powerful.
- Obviously, complicated, expensive, big.
- Can't do I12, because too long (and torsion along crankshaft). Also,
  the car can't fit it.
