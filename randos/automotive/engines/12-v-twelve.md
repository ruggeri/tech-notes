# V12

## V12: 2x I6s, Balance

- V12: Basically two I6s set at an angle.
  - Thus, I'm not going to re-do my balance frequency analysis.
- I6s already have perfect primary and secondary balance. And so does
  the V12, which is basically just the composition of two of them.
- The chosen V-angle does not change the perfect primary and secondary
  balance, since those are inherited from composition of two inline
  sixes.
- A V-angle of 60deg is most common (I'll explain why momentarily).
  - Almost every V12 road car uses a 60deg V-angle.
    - Aston Martin, BMW, Ferrari (some), Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz.
  - That's probably because a flat 12 is very wide.
  - The exception is Ferrari. They made 65deg engines for a few
    production cars. Some other manufacturers make other V-angles for
    motor racing (normally between 65deg-85deg), but I don't think for
    production vehicles.
  - Ferrari also made a number of 180deg V-12 engines. These are
    sometimes called "flat-twelves." Please note that they are _not_
    boxer twelves. I think a boxer twelve wouldn't have any advantage,
    and a lot more crank pins.

## V12: Firing Interval

- Let's assume there are six crank pins, and the V-angle is 60deg.
- Let's label the left bank cylinders 1-6 and the right bank cylinders
  7-12. But let's label the left 1-6 and the right 7-12 in reverse
  order.
- That is, 1 and 12 share a crankpin, and 6 and 7 share a crankpin.
- We know a typical inline six firing order is 1-5-3-6-2-4.
- So let's do that on the other bank, too. We'll fire 7-11-9-12-8-10.
- Of course, the firing of the right bank is delayed by 60deg.
- Note that the I6 has 60deg alternations between 2x power and 1x power.
  Thus, with a 60deg offset, you constantly have 3x cylinders on a power
  stroke.
- This is very even power delivery. You constantly have 3x cylinders on
  different thirds of the power stroke.
- You can also do a 180deg flat-twelve offset. Again, you'll have 3x
  cylinders on different thirds of the power stroke.

## 120deg V12

- If you mate two I6s with a 120deg V-angle, you're going to get uneven
  power: 4x-2x-4x-...
- **TODO**: I think you need to use a different crank. I think you need
  to mate two V-6 engines in line. I think it will give you perfect
  primary and secondary balance, and also even firing. But I haven't
  studied V-6 engines yet.

## V12 Discussion

- I believe any angle other than 60deg, 120deg, and 180deg will not give
  an even firing interval.
  - Certainly not if using a typical inline 6 crank.
- The 60deg V-12 gives very even power delivery. Three cylinders are on
  different parts of the power stroke at any given time.
- You can make an engine of equivalent displacement, but with more
  cylinders. And if you do that, you can probably rev the engine much
  higher, creating more power.
- Supercars often have this engine. Very smooth and very powerful.
- Obviously, complicated, expensive, big.
- Can't do I12, because too long (and torsion along crankshaft). Also,
  the car can't fit it.
