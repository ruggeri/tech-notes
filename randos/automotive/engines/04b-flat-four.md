- This is also called a Boxer 4.
- It was used on 1974-1987 Honda Gold Wing.
  - Which then upgraded to a flat six.
- Today, this engine is mostly used by Subaru.
  - In the Subaru, I think they like that the weight is low.
  - I think also they prefer the flat four to the inline four maybe
    because it gives space for the AWD?
- It should have primary and secondary reciprocating balance, just like
  the boxer twin.
  - However, there is an improvement here over the I4, because the I4
    does not have secondary reciprocating balance.
- Has an even firing interval of 180deg. Fires 1-3-2-4. That is, the
  left bank of cylinders (which are at 180deg from each other) fire,
  then the right bank of cylinders.
- Next we consider primary rotational balance.
  - We know that the boxer twin does not have primary rotational
    balance, because of the offset of the pistons, which do not share a
    crank pin.
  - However, I believe that each pair of boxers in the flat four will
    want to rotate opposite the other.
  - Thus, there is no net rocking of the engine.
  - Driving 4 Answers agrees with my analysis.
  - In this respect, the flat four is better than the boxer twin. It
    equals the I4.
- However, the secondary rotational balance problem will still be
  present. That's because, when separated by 180deg, the two cylinder
  banks will want to rotate in the same direction. So they double the
  secondary vibration.
