- Note that compression ratio doesn't increase power because there's
  more air and thus you can burn more fuel. Compression ratio isn't
  about shoving more air into the cylinder like turbo and
  supercharging.
- It's that the peak temperature is higher, so more work is done on
  expansion stroke. And the stroke is effectively longer. You can
  imagine an engine with a _zero_ compression ratio; it obviously
  doesn't do any work.
- I think that compression means that you get more work out of the
  same fuel/air drawn into the cylinder. It's more _efficient_. But
  it also makes better power because each combustion cycle makes
  more work.
- You do have to do more negative work on the compression stroke.
  But this is offset by more positive work on combustion stroke.
- Limits to compression include knock, but also as you compress gas
  further you start to lose heat to cylinder walls, which eventually
  means _worse_ efficiency. You also have higher pressures which
  means more stress. But in ideal Otto cycle yes higher compression
  is always better.
- Efficiency of Otto cycle is `1 - 1/(compression_ratio ^ (gamma-1))`,
  where gamma is the adiabatic index.
- The point being, effect of increasing compression ratio eventually
  decreases.
- Since compression is good for power and good for efficiency, why
  do bikes run low compression? Because longevity of engine,
  availability/price of low octane fuel, and also because I think
  high CR means that while mpg might be better (and thus lower CO2
  emission), NOx emission might be _worse_. Which means running
  higher compression might mean bigger catalytic converters.
- As another note, the "Atkinson" cycle is a version of the Otto
  cycle where the compression stroke is longer than the power
  stroke. That lets you get more work out of the fuel combusted.
  - In olden days, there was some complicated geometry for the
    Atkinson engine.
  - Today, you just keep the intake valve open longer past BDC to
    push air back out. So the effective intake and compression
    strokes are shorter. You'll inject and burn less fuel.
  - Since for the same displacement you are breathing less, you have
    lower power density. But you make that power more efficiently.

    defines it and describes knock as the limit to compression ratio.

    efficiency. Describes how increasing CR increases thermal
    efficiency and power (per liter).
