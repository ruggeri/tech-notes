# V-Twin

## 90deg V-Twin Firing

```
# Shared crank pin. But bank angle between cylinders is 90deg.
#
# I'll imagine crankshaft spins from left piston to right. Left will
# fire first.

-   0deg -  90deg: Piston L combustion A,  Piston R exhaust B     (power)
-  90deg - 180deg: Piston L combustion B,  Piston R intake A      (power)
- 180deg - 270deg: Piston L exhaust A,     Piston R intake B      (silence)
- 270deg - 360deg: Piston L exhaust B,     Piston R compression A (silence)
- 360deg - 450deg: Piston L intake A,      Piston R compression B (silence)
- 450deg - 540deg: Piston L intake B,      Piston R combustion A  (power)
- 540deg - 630deg: Piston L compression A, Piston R combustion B  (power)
- 630deg - 720deg: Piston L compression B, Piston R exhaust A     (silence)

# Note: uneven interval of silence between power pulses. 270deg then
# 90deg of silence between 180deg power pulses. This is the same as the
# 270deg crank inline twin.

## 90deg V-Twin Balance Analysis

- Primary translational imbalance. We need to sum two primary force
  waveforms. The waveforms are (1) vector valued, oriented at 90deg, and
  (2) out-of-phase by 90deg.
  - The primary translational force will continuously rotate. The
    magnitude of the force will be constant, but its direction will
    change. It will be oriented in the direction of the crank journal.
  - This force can be _eliminated_ with a crankshaft counterweight.
- Primary rotational balance
  - Because they share a crank pin, the cylinders are almost in the same
    plane, with force directed radially. Any rotational balance should
    be very minor.
- Secondary translational imbalance.
  - We again need to sum two vector values, each oriented at 90deg.
    However, one is 180deg out of phase with the other.
  - This should shake back-and-forward alone the line that is 45deg from
    each cylinder.
- Secondary rotational balance
  - Again, since the cylinders are almost in the same plane, we do not
    expect a rotational imbalance.

## Counterweight Balancing

- Let's eliminate the primary translational imbalance with a
  counterweight on the crankshaft.
- You want to generate a force that is always equal and opposite to the
  primary translational force.
- Since the primary translational force rotates, you need the balancing
  force to rotate at the same rate and direction.
- That suggests adding a _counterweight_ to the crankshaft. It can be
  opposite the crank pin.
- It should weigh approximately 100% of a piston.
- We know it takes a centripetal force on the counterweight to spin it
  around.
- The counterweight will be opposite each cylinder when the
  corresponding piston is at TDC. That's exactly when the translational
  force points out in the direction of the cylinder.
- If we use a single pair of counterweights straddling the crankpin (and
  the CoM), then they shouldn't cause a torque.
- To balance the secondary forces, we need something that runs at 2x the
  frequency of the crankshaft. We'd need a balancing shaft. I don't
  believe any V-twin bothers with this.

## Mounting

- Almost always transverse mounted (crankshaft perpendicular to bike
  body; easily drives chain).
  - Exception is Moto Guzzi, which mounts longitudinal (crankshaft
    parallel to bike body).
  - That's an advantage for air cooling, but a disadvantage for width.
  - I believe Moto Guzzi uses a crank shaft.

## Examples

- V-Twins tend to be less common than inline twins.
  - More expensive. And 270deg inline twin gets the sound people want.
  - And V-twin is harder to "package" (fit into the motorcycle body).
- Harley-Davidson bikes use a narrow V-angle (45deg) and large
  cylinders.
- Ducati focuses on 90deg V-twin and V4s. I think all their bikes are
  V-twins or V4s.
  - One cylinder faces almost forward, and the other up-and-down. They
    call it an L-twin sometimes.
  - They sometimes call this engine "Testastretta 11Â°"; the 11 refers to
    something totally unrelated to what we're discussing (valve
    overlap).
  - A downside to this design is that you need a longer wheelbase to
    accommodate the horizontal cylinder. That impacts maneuverability.
  - Thus the SuperSport 950 is actually pretty long.
- Moto Guzzi specializes in transverse 90deg V-twin.
- Suzuki makes the V-Stroms and the SV650 with 90deg V-Twin.
- KTM does use V-twins on their 1290 ADV bike. They use 75deg.
- Honda and Kawasaki don't make any V-twin or V4 bikes. Probably Japan
  doesn't do them in part because they are more expensive.
  - Also I think Japanese bikes were early to use water cooling and
    didn't need the air cooling benefit for V-twins.
- Aprilia makes V4s, but does 270deg inline twins instead of V-twins.
- BMW and Triumph don't do any V-twins.

## Discussion

- I think the major downside to 90deg V-Twin is that it has a lot of
  deadspace between the cylinders and it's hard to fit. That's why
  Suzuki might use it on V-Stroms which aren't intended to be that
  maneuverable, or Moto Guzzi might try to mount longitudinally.
  - Note that the Ducati Supersport 950 does have a fairly long
    wheelbase for an alleged sport-bike.
- I think geometry might allow you to get longer stroke than in an
  inline engine. That might help with displacement vs an inline twin,
  for the same bike height.

## Comparison With Inline Twins

- The uneven firing interval gives a characteristic sound, but it also
  means uneven power delivery.
  - Not worse than the 180deg inline twin though...
  - This could be good on dirt, because it allows the tire to recover
    traction.
- The 270deg parallel twins have a lot of the same characteristics as
  the V-twins.
- I can't find any justification for the belief that V-Twins make more
  low-end torque than inline twins.
  - I think that maybe V-Twins tend to have longer strokes, because of
    their geometry.
  - But then we ask again whether longer strokes even make more torque.
- I think that the main tradeoff is really about packaging and cost.
  - It's easier to fit an inline twin into a bike.
  - Cost to produce and maintenance are cheaper on the inline twin. You
    only have one case, valvetrain, et cetera.
- OTOH, V-Twin might be narrower (when mounted transversely), because
  it's only one cylinder of width.
  - Though Kevin Cameron says you still need starter and alternator,
    which adds width too.

  - Here, Kevin talks about some pros/cons of inline vs v-twins.
  - But it's mostly about packaging, cost, and balancing.
  - He doesn't otherwise suggest that a V-twin could make more low-end
    torque, like you hear a lot of people say.
