# Flat (Boxer) Twin

## Timing

```
# 180deg crankpin offset. Cylinders will move in opposite direction
# along the same axis.

-   0deg - 180deg: Piston 1 combustion,  Piston 2 intake      (power)
- 180deg - 360deg: Piston 1 exhaust,     Piston 2 compression (silence)
- 360deg - 480deg: Piston 1 intake,      Piston 2 combustion  (power)
- 480deg - 640deg: Piston 1 compression, Piston 2 exhaust     (silence)

# Note: Alternates between 180deg of power and 180deg of silence.

# Note: This is the same timing as a 360deg inline twin, so should have
# same exhaust note.
```

## Balance Analysis

- Primary reciprocating balance: take individual primary force
  waveforms. They are identical and "in phase", except that the
  direction of force of one waveform is inverted. Thus, summing them
  results in perfect destruction of the waveforms, and perfect
  reciprocating balance.
- Primary rotational imbalance: here, we invert one waveform. Thus they
  perfectly constructively interfere. However, the magnitude of the
  resulting rotational imbalance depends on the distance between
  cylinder centers. That is as small as having two separate crank pins
  allows.
- Secondary reciprocating balance: again, take two identical waveforms
  (running at twice the crank frequency). They are "in phase" in the
  sense that both cylinders are at TDC or BDC at the same time. Except
  that one is inverted because of the opposite orientation of the
  cylinders. Thus, they destructively interfere.
- Secondary rotational imbalance: again, we invert one waveform, and
  they constructively interfere. Again, the resulting torque may not be
  very significant, because the distance between cylinder centers is as
  small as having two separate crankpins allows.

## Discussion

- This is typical of BMW motorcycles. Nobody else does flat twin engine
  motorcycles.
  - I think they only do it on their larger displacement engines of at
    least 1200cc.
  - They make about 130HP.
- Two cylinders are opposed 180 degrees across the crankshaft.
- Typically longitudinal mounted.
  - Means crank runs parallel to bike axis. Cylinders stick out
    perpendicular from the bike.
  - Can do aircooling this way. However, modern BMW engines are liquid
    cooled.
  - Low center of gravity.
  - Danger to the cylinders in a tip-over collision with the roadway.
  - I believe that shaft drive is more attractive in this configuration.
    Which is why BMWs very frequently use shaft drives.
- Cylinder firing is offset by 360deg. This gives even power with 180deg
  silence between combustion.
  - 180deg power, 180deg silence, 180deg power, 180deg silence.
  - Should sound like a 360deg twin. Which most people find very boring.
- Let's compare a boxer twin and a 180deg inline twin:
  - Both have primary translational balance.
  - Both have primary rotational imbalance. The boxer twin might have
    better imbalance because the cylinders are closer in line with each
    other (but not exactly, because separate crank pins).
  - Their relationship to secondary balance reverses.
  - The boxer twin has secondary translational balance. The 180deg twin
    has the torques of the two cylinders constructively interfere.
  - The boxer twin has secondary rotational imbalance. The 180deg twin
    has secondary rotational balance. However, the boxer twin rotational
    imbalance is hopefully minor, again, because the cylinders are
    almost across from each other.
  - Last, the flat twin gives even 360deg firing, versus 180deg-540deg
    firing.
- I believe the boxer is generally superior to the 180deg twin from a
  balance standpoint. The primary rotational balance is a lot less
  because the cylinders are almost opposite. It trades secondary
  translational balance for a secondary rotational imbalance, but again
  this is minor because the crankpins are so near.
- I believe that if you use a single crank pin (sometimes called a
  180degree V-twin), you can get rid of the rotational imbalance.
  - If you do this, then the engine is no longer a boxer. And it will
    change the firing interval to 180deg power, 180deg power, 360deg
    silence like a 180deg inline twin.
  - You're also going to lose reciprocating balance. I think it will
    have the reciprocating balance of a 360deg twin (both pistons move
    in same direction always).
  - I don't think anyone does this. Some flat engines with more
    cylinders are 180deg V-engines though (Ferrari Testarossa, I think).
  - Very few V-twins ever did a V-angle greater than 90deg, and I think
    none did 180deg.
- Because of the even firing order, you don't get the cool syncopated
  sound of the V-Twin or 270deg Parallel designs.
- One thing people like about this configuration is that the weight is
  down low.
- I think a major downside is clearance though while cornering. You
  can't really design a sportbike this way.
- Other downsides versus an inline engine are the two cylinder heads,
  valvetrains, exhausts.
- Ultimately, to make really high HP without having a crazy huge engine,
  you need to reach high revs. And this is going to be easier to achieve
  with more cylinders.
- BMWs flat twins are big (about 1200cc) and have high torque numbers
  down low. But they're heavy, maybe not that maneuverable, presumably
  expensive to maintain.
