**Flat (Boxer) Twin**

- This is typical of BMW motorcycles. Nobody else does flat engine
  motorcycles.
- Two cylinders are opposed 180 degrees across the crankshaft.
- Typically longitudinal mounted.
  - Means crank runs parallel to bike axis. Cylinders stick out
    perpendicular from the bike.
  - Can do aircooling this way. However, modern BMW engines are liquid
    cooled.
  - Low center of gravity.
  - Danger to the cylinders in a collision.
  - I believe that shaft drive is more attractive in this configuration.
    Which is why BMWs very frequently use shaft drives.
- Cylinder firing is offset by 360deg. This gives even power with 180deg
  silence between combustion.
- No net force, so primary reciprocating balance is perfect.
  - But there is some rocking (rotating imbalance), similar to the
    180deg twin, because of the distance between crank pins.
- Secondary reciprocating balance is also perfect, btw.
  - This is because of the opposition of the pistons. This is superior
    to the 180deg parallel twin.
  - There is secondary rotational imbalance, though.
- I believe that if you use a single crank pin (sometimes called a
  180degree V-twin), you can get rid of the rotational imbalance.
  - Regardless, the rotational imbalance is smaller than would be in an
    inline twin, because the crank pins can be placed closer together,
    because the boxer's cylinders don't need to sit side-by-side. They
    can be almost directly across from each other.
- Because of the even firing order, you don't get the cool syncopated
  sound of the V-Twin or 270deg Parallel designs.
- One thing people like about this configuration is that the weight is
  down low.
- I think a major downside is clearance though while cornering. You
  can't really design a sportbike this way.
- Other downsides versus an inline engine are the two cylinder heads,
  valvetrains, exhausts.
- Ultimately, to make really high HP without having a crazy huge engine,
  you need to reach high revs. And this is going to be easier to achieve
  with more cylinders.
