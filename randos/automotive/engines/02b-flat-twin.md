**Flat (Boxer) Twin**

```
# 180deg crankpin offset. Cylinders will move in opposite direction along same axis.

-   0deg - 180deg: Piston 1 combustion,  Piston 2 intake      (power)
- 180deg - 360deg: Piston 1 exhaust,     Piston 2 compression (silence)
- 360deg - 480deg: Piston 1 intake,      Piston 2 combustion  (power)
- 480deg - 640deg: Piston 1 compression, Piston 2 exhaust     (silence)

# Note: Alternates between 180deg of power and 180deg of silence.
# Note: This is the same timing as a 360deg inline twin, so should have same exhaust note.

- This is typical of BMW motorcycles. Nobody else does flat engine
  motorcycles.
  - I think they only do it on their larger displacement engines of at
    least 1200cc.
  - They make about 130HP.
- Two cylinders are opposed 180 degrees across the crankshaft.
- Typically longitudinal mounted.
  - Means crank runs parallel to bike axis. Cylinders stick out
    perpendicular from the bike.
  - Can do aircooling this way. However, modern BMW engines are liquid
    cooled.
  - Low center of gravity.
  - Danger to the cylinders in a collision.
  - I believe that shaft drive is more attractive in this configuration.
    Which is why BMWs very frequently use shaft drives.
- Cylinder firing is offset by 360deg. This gives even power with 180deg
  silence between combustion.
  - 180deg power, 180deg silence, 180deg power, 180deg silence.
  - Should sound like a 360deg twin. Which most people find very boring.
- No net force, so primary reciprocating balance is perfect.
  - But there is some rocking (rotating imbalance), similar to the
    180deg twin, because of the distance between crank pins.
  - But the crank pin offset is less, because the cylinders can be
    placed almost across from each other, whereas the inline twin needs
    cylinders side-by-side.
- Secondary reciprocating balance is also perfect, btw.
  - This is because of the opposition of the pistons. This is superior
    to the 180deg parallel twin.
  - There is secondary rotational imbalance, though.
- I believe that if you use a single crank pin (sometimes called a
  180degree V-twin), you can get rid of the rotational imbalance.
  - If you do this, then the engine is no longer a boxer. And it will
    change the firing interval to 180deg power, 180deg power, 360deg
    silence like a 180deg inline twin.
  - You're also going to lose reciprocating balance. I think it will
    have the reciprocating balance of a 360deg twin (both pistons move
    in same direction always).
  - I don't think anyone does this. Some flat engines with more
    cylinders are 180deg V-engines though (Ferrari Testarossa, I think).
- Because of the even firing order, you don't get the cool syncopated
  sound of the V-Twin or 270deg Parallel designs.
- One thing people like about this configuration is that the weight is
  down low.
- I think a major downside is clearance though while cornering. You
  can't really design a sportbike this way.
- Other downsides versus an inline engine are the two cylinder heads,
  valvetrains, exhausts.
- Ultimately, to make really high HP without having a crazy huge engine,
  you need to reach high revs. And this is going to be easier to achieve
  with more cylinders.
- BMWs flat twins are big (about 1200cc) and have high torque numbers
  down low. But they're heavy, maybe not that maneuverable, presumably
  expensive to maintain.
