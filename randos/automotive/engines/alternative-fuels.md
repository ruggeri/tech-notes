- Petrol: pretty high energy density per kg (46MJ/kg) and liter
  (34MJ/L).
- EV Batteries
  - No emissions, either greenhouse or particulate. But how do you
    generate the power?
    - Generation to wheels is about 75% efficiency.
  - Very heavy, with less energy density per liter vs gasoline. More
    like 1MJ/kg and 2MJ/L.
  - Efficient use of input power. About 88% energy efficiency vs 22% for
    petrol ICE. So need about 15x the battery mass vs petrol mass.
  - Very good low RPM torque, better than engines!
  - Low maintenance
  - Heaviness also increases tire wear particulates.
  - Charging time is slow. Battery infrastructure is uneven.
  - Dirty to mine/refine battery materials.
- Hydrogen (ICE and fuel cells)
  - Biggest problem is that hydrogen, while energy dense per kg
    (120MJ/kg, way better than petrol), is very poor by _volume_. Even
    at cryro temperatures or 700bar it's between 5-10MJ/L (a third of
    petrol).
  - So you need liquid hydrogen tanks.
  - Only emission is water. But how do you produced the hydrogen?
    Traditionally you can do "steam methane reforming", which is a
    chemical process that produces a lot of CO2. You can also make
    "green" hydrogen, which uses electricity and water to make hydrogen,
    which has low energy efficiency, but doesn't otherwise create CO2.
  - Hydrogen has some problems with safety. As the temp raises, it needs
    to vent the hydrogen, which could be a fire hazard.
  - You can burn hydrogen in an ICE, which is fine and doesn't produce
    CO2, just water. But you often use it in a **fuel cell**, which is
    more efficient and turns the fuel and oxygen into _electricity_. So
    if you're going to go hydrogen, you probably want to go fuel cell...
  - Hydrogen engines can put up power numbers similar to petrol. It
    burns fast.
  - Generation -> electrolysis -> hydrogen -> fuel cell is maybe ~30%
    efficiency generation to wheels. Generation -> electrolysis ->
    hydrogen -> ICE is maybe 20%.
    - So why not just use batteries? Which basically give enough auto
      range with fewer problems.
  - Hydrogen might be more attractive than ammonia or batteries for
    _airplanes_ where mass matters. But volume would still be a big
    problem. For shipping, ammonia or methanol makes more sense because
    of easier storage.
  - Maybe hydrogen makes most sense for industry, where they need a
    chemical reactant. It could also be an energy _storage_ solution,
    but not clear why that's better than other storage (like pumped
    hydro, which is way more efficient), and for transport using HVDC.
    - Most hydrogen today for chemical use is made via "Steam Methane
      Reforming", which just reacts natural gas (methane) with H2O
      (steam). This releases CO2. So replacing this need with
      electrolysis makes sense.
- Ammonia
  - Like hydrogen, contains no carbon and can burn without any CO2
    emission.
  - Can produce with hydrogen, which itself can be produced with
    electricity that could be green.
  - Much easier to store than hydrogen (liquid, no cryro). In fact,
    there's already a worldwide ammonia supply chain because
    fertilizers.
  - Can be burned in ICE or as fuel for fuel cells. About 20-25% of
    energy put into electrolysis and Haber-Bosch synthesis gets to the
    propeller via ICE. If you use fuel cell you can get maybe 30%
  - Only has about 40% of energy capacity of petrol per kg (20MJ/kg).
    About 12 MJ/L, which is ~1/3 of petrol (similar to hydrogen).
  - Low flame speed means you make **low power**. This is probably
    unacceptable for cars and planes.
  - Toxic!
  - Produces NOx when burned. NOx is basically toxic. Typical combustion
    byproduct at high temperatures. Catalytic converter's most important
    job is to remove NOx.
  - Ammonia is possibly a bet for shipping, where you have big engines,
    and often don't need to make that much _power_, just torque.
    Batteries are too heavy for shipping, and too slow to charge. NOx
    emissions are not a big deal if over the open ocean.
  - For planes, you probably don't want such a toxic fuel. And the
    energy per kg is too low. And NOx at altitude does have a climate
    impact.
- Ethanol
  - Ethanol has lower energy per liter than petrol (21MJ/L), but it is
    very high octane, so you can run it at high compression, get better
    efficiency, and more power. Race cars sometimes run on E85.
  - Ethanol will have lower MPG, because of lower energy density.
  - At low blends, can drop in to existing ICE engines. But does maybe
    attack some sealing in older engines. Newer engines generally
    designed to tolerate it. Just has to do with the chemistry of
    ethanol.
  - Basically, ethanol is carbon **recycling**. The land grows the
    ethanol, which sucks out CO2 from the atmosphere. Then you burn it,
    and put the CO2 back in.
    - Vs petrol which was sequestered millions of years ago, and after
      you burn it how can you put it back in the earth?
    - The problem is where do you get the land from? If it's existing
      cropland, and you don't just displace the food grown there, then
      this is a net win (CO2 is pulled out of air on planting, and
      consistently recycled).
    - But if new land is cleared (either to plant corn, or to plant the
      food you displaced), then you clear trees and put CO2 in the air
      again. Hopefully you burn the trees to generate some power... But
      plowing also stirs up soil carbon.
    - You clear forest, which dumps carbon into atmosphere. And then yes
      you do get a certain amount of recycling from the ethanol. But it
      takes a long time to pay back. Forest to corn ethanol can take
      30-100+ years to payback.
      - Keep in mind: the forest would have kept growing, so it would
        have kept pulling out CO2.
    - So it doesn't make a quick dent in CO2 emission.
    - And fertilizer will make everything worse.
  - In US, ethanol competes with cropland, raising food prices. And can
    drive deforestation/planting of new farmland.
    - Fertilizer use for growing contributes N2O emission, which is a
      worse GHG than CO2. And it lasts for about 120yrs.
    - Also, it's not very energy efficient to grow fuel. Only about
      30%-60% energy return.
    - Best case is 20-40% less CO2 than petrol, but near zero benefit if
      you drive land use change.
  - Sugarcane in Brazil is a much better source, because you can more
    easily grow more ethanol per acre, and you can use less fertilizer.
    Net energy return can exceed 8x.
    - Sugarcane ethanol in Brazil might actually be good, whereas US
      ethanol is probably not good enough to justify subsidy.
  - Next, we consider emissions: CO2 and NOx emission is pretty similar
    to petrol, though particulates are quite a bit lower.
  - Already 10% of US gasoline is ethanol. 40% of US corn crop!!
- Renewable Diesel/Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (and obsolete biodiesel)
  - Chemically very similar to petroleum diesel.
  - Starts from waste cooking oils, animal fats, soybean oil...
  - Biodiesel has basically been superseded by this. HVO is drop-in for
    diesel, whereas biodiesel can be blended only up to 20%. Biodiesel
    makes more NOx, stores worse, doesn't flow as well in cold...
  - HVO does need hydrogen, most of which is fossil derived. And the
    amount of waste oil is limited. You can grow soybeans, but then you
    get into land use problems.
  - HVO is a better _fuel_, but biodiesel doesn't need hydrogen, so it
    can be more climate friendly. But the hydrogen you need for HVO
    isn't wasted: it's stored in the molecule, and you get that energy
    back when burning it. So biodiesel is 60-85% energy efficient, while
    HVO is 50-80% efficient.
  - In the end, HVO ends up being more practical for not very much
    penalty.
  - The goal here is diesel machines in industry (like excavators). They
    run all day, and you can't be charging them slowly. They might be
    far from mains power.
  - Better density, easier to handle than hydrogen, works with existing
    machines, higher efficiency. But the problem is that it's not very
    green once you account for land use change!
- E-Fuel (synthetic petrol/diesel)
  - About 10-15% efficiency. Basically silly low efficiency compared to
    electric vehicles. Probably no future, except maybe for super luxury
    petrol powered sports cars and motorsports. Everything else can be
    batteries.
  - Main advantage is that it's a drop-in replacement for petrol/diesel.
  - Doesn't really make sense for shipping. Lower efficiency than
    ammonia and methanol. But it is easier to handle because lower
    toxicity.
  - Maybe makes most sense in aviation, as a drop-in replacement. Huge
    cost penalty, but it has the density, and basically already works.
  - Could also work for motorcycles if you see those as luxury vehicles
    that don't demand lots of fuel.
  - Look at problems below with green CO2 capture accounting for
    methanol. You can only produce e-fuel if you have cheap
    direct-air-capture, or some industry you _can't_ or _won't_
    decarbonize.
- LPG (Liquid Propane Gas) and CNG (compressed natural gas)
  - **TODO**
- Methanol
  - Liquid at ambient pressure/temp, not toxic like ammonia, easier to
    store than hydrogen. Engines already exist.
  - 50% less energy by volume compared to diesel, emits CO2. Climate
    benefit clearly depends on how its made.
    - You want to do electrolysis to get H2, and carbon capture to get
      CO2.
    - Carbon capture can become more expensive as methanol scales,
      because it's hard to get out of the air, and as industry
      decarbonizes, it will be hard to capture it at plants.
    - So truly green methanol will be more expensive because it requires
      both green H2 and carbon capture.
    - Also, it's harder to make sure CO2 capture markets aren't gamed.
      Okay, direct-air-capture isn't easily gameable. But ammonia isn't
      truly green if it relies on some other industry that shouldn't
      itself be producing CO2 emissions.
    - This differs from hydrogen. Yes, you can produce grey hydrogen
      through SMR. But hydrogen isn't a _byproduct_, it _is_ the
      product. So you can't "wash" dirty industries in the way that you
      can with
  - Methanol is itself an important chemical in industry so green
    production is useful regardless.
  - Efficiency from generation to propeller is about 20-25%, same as
    green ammonia.
  - Methanol and ammonia both have similar MJ/kg and MJ/L.
- Other Ideas
  - Hybridization: we've already discussed that elsewhere. It's
    combination of electric drive and ICE drive.
  - Electric catenary/track power: used for trains and some trucks/buses
    with overhead wires.
  - Nuclear: works for naval ships, and icebreakers, could come to cargo
    ships someday...
