- Petrol: pretty high energy density per kg (46MJ/kg) and liter
  (34MJ/L).
- EV Batteries
  - No emissions, either greenhouse or particulate. But how do you
    generate the power?
  - Very heavy, with less energy density per liter vs gasoline. More
    like 1MJ/kg and 2MJ/L.
  - Efficient use of input power. About 88% energy efficiency vs 22% for
    petrol ICE. So need about 15x the battery mass vs petrol mass.
  - Very good low RPM torque, better than engines!
  - Low maintenance
  - Heaviness also increases tire wear particulates.
  - Charging time is slow. Battery infrastructure is uneven.
  - Dirty to mine/refine battery materials.
- Hydrogen fuel cells
  - Biggest problem is that hydrogen, while energy dense per kg
    (120MJ/kg, way better than petrol), is very poor by _volume_. Even
    at cryro temperatures or 700bar it's between 5-10MJ/L (a third of
    petrol).
  - So you need liquid hydrogen tanks.
  - Only emission is water. But how do you produced the hydrogen?
    Traditionally you can do "steam methane reforming", which is a
    chemical process that produces a lot of CO2. You can also make
    "green" hydrogen, which uses electricity and water to make hydrogen,
    which has low energy efficiency, but doesn't otherwise create CO2.
  - Hydrogen has some problems with safety. As the temp raises, it needs
    to vent the hydrogen, which could be a fire hazard.
  - You can burn hydrogen in an ICE, which is fine and doesn't produce
    CO2, just water. But you often use it in a **fuel cell**, which is
    more efficient and turns the fuel and oxygen into _electricity_. So
    if you're going to go hydrogen, you probably want to go fuel cell...
  - Hydrogen engines can put up power numbers similar to petrol. It
    burns fast.
  - Hydrogen might be more attractive than ammonia or batteries for
    _airplanes_ where mass matters. But volume is a big problem.
- Ammonia
  - Like hydrogen, contains no carbon and can burn without any CO2
    emission.
  - Can produce with hydrogen, which itself can be produced with
    electricity that could be green.
  - Much easier to store than hydrogen (liquid, no cryro).
  - Can be burned in ICE or as fuel for fuel cells.
  - Only has about 40% of energy capacity of petrol per kg (20MJ/kg).
    About 12 MJ/L, which is ~1/3 of petrol (similar to hydrogen).
  - Low flame speed means you make low power. This is probably
    unacceptable for cars.
  - Toxic!
  - Produces NOx when burned.
  - Ammonia is possibly a bet for shipping, where you have big engines,
    and often don't need to make that much _power_, just torque.
    Batteries are too heavy for shipping, and too slow to charge,
- Ethanol
  - Ethanol has lower energy per liter than petrol (21MJ/L), but it is
    very high octane, so you can run it at high compression, get better
    efficiency, and more power. Race cars sometimes run on E85.
  - Ethanol will have lower MPG, because of lower energy density.
  - At low blends, can drop in to existing ICE engines. But does maybe
    attack some sealing in older engines. Newer engines generally
    designed to tolerate it. Just has to do with the chemistry of
    ethanol.
  - Basically, ethanol is carbon **recycling**. The land grows the
    ethanol, which sucks out CO2 from the atmosphere. Then you burn it,
    and put the CO2 back in.
    - Vs petrol which was sequestered millions of years ago, and after
      you burn it how can you put it back in the earth?
    - The problem is where do you get the land from? If it's existing
      cropland, and you don't just displace the food grown there, then
      this is a net win (CO2 is pulled out of air on planting, and
      consistently recycled).
    - But if new land is cleared (either to plant corn, or to plant the
      food you displaced), then you clear trees and put CO2 in the air
      again. Hopefully you burn the trees to generate some power... But
      plowing also stirs up soil carbon.
    - You clear forest, which dumps carbon into atmosphere. And then yes
      you do get a certain amount of recycling from the ethanol. But it
      takes a long time to pay back. Forest to corn ethanol can take
      30-100+ years to payback.
      - Keep in mind: the forest would have kept growing, so it would
        have kept pulling out CO2.
    - So it doesn't make a quick dent in CO2 emission.
    - And fertilizer will make everything worse.
  - In US, ethanol competes with cropland, raising food prices. And can
    drive deforestation/planting of new farmland.
    - Fertilizer use for growing contributes N2O emission, which is a
      worse GHG than CO2. And it lasts for about 120yrs.
    - Also, it's not very energy efficient to grow fuel. Only about
      30%-60% energy return.
    - Best case is 20-40% less CO2 than petrol, but near zero benefit if
      you drive land use change.
  - Sugarcane in Brazil is a much better source, because you can more
    easily grow more ethanol per acre, and you can use less fertilizer.
    Net energy return can exceed 8x.
    - Sugarcane ethanol in Brazil might actually be good, whereas US
      ethanol is probably not good enough to justify subsidy.
  - Next, we consider emissions: CO2 and NOx emission is pretty similar
    to petrol, though particulates are quite a bit lower.
- Biodiesel

- LPG (Liquid Propane Gas) and CNG (compressed natural gas)

- Other Ideas
  - Hybridization: we've already discussed that elsewhere. It's
    combination of electric drive and ICE drive.
  - Electric catenary/track power: used for trains and some trucks/buses
    with overhead wires.
  - Nuclear: works for naval ships, and icebreakers, could come to cargo
    ships someday...
