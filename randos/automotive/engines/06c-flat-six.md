- This is most associated with Porsche.
  - Subaru also used to make one, I think.
- The Porsche and Subaru engines are boxer sixes; they have horizontally
  opposed cylinders.
- These are require two camshafts, but are shorter than inline six
  engines. They can also get weigh low.
- They have even 120 deg firing angle.
- When set up as a boxer, they have no rocking couple.
- Well, the cylinders are not perfectly opposed, but they are almost.
  All boxer engine cylinders must be offset a little because they need
  separate crankpins.
- D4A gives a number of reasons why the flat/boxer six engine might have
  a lighter crankshaft.
- Main downside versus inline six are that it is wide, so hard to fit in
  an engine bay, and it has two camshafts.
