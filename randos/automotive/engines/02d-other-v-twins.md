I haven't studied these non-90deg V-Twin designs that much. They
are/were mainly used on cruiser bikes.

**~45deg V-Twins**

- These are typical of cruiser type bikes.
- Almost all Harleys are air-cooled 45-deg twin engines.
  - Their lightest street cruiser bikes use a 60-deg engine.
  - But all others are the classic 45-degree V-Twin.
  - Harley uses fork-and-blade connecting rods, which means the
    cylinders fire in the same plane. So you only need to analyze this
    plane.
  - Sharing a crankpin means that you have a 315-405 firing interval.
    This gives their classic sound.
- In terms of primary imbalance, a 45-deg twin is going to be quite
  similar to a parallel twin with a 360deg firing order.
  - That's because both cylinders are at about TDC at the same time.
  - BTW, typically these bikes are _overbalanced_, to reduce vertical
    vibration by a bit more than 50%, at the cost of more horizontal
    vibration. That's based on the subjective experience of the rider.
- Another note on sound: Harleys crank at lower RPMs, so you can hear
  the syncopation more than Ducatis, which crank at higher RPMs and
  start to sound more droney.
- Japanese Cruisers are ~55deg V-Twins
  - Honda Shadow (52deg), Suzuki Boulevard (C50: 45deg M109: 54deg),
    Kawisaki Vulcan (900: 55deg, 1700: 52deg), and Yamaha V-Star and
    Bolt R Spec (60deg).
  - I think a lot of manufacturers are getting out of the cruiser game
    because demand is drying up.
  - All transverse mounted.
- Firing of 45deg V-Twin is less uneven than 90deg V-Twin.

**Weird/Other V-Twins**

- KTM 1290
  - 75deg angle. Firing interval of 285-435.
  - As discussed previously, a parallel twin with a 75deg crank has the
    same firing interval.
  - **TODO**: Maybe D4A has some description of why you would do this?
