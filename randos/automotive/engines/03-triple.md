- Typically mounted transverse, and the headers will look like a
  "trident" a bit.
  - Exception is Rocket III which has a longitudinal mounted engine.
- Yamaha and Triumph are the only bikes that make triples.
- Typically make about 80-120HP.
- The "typical" setup is 120deg crank offset.
  - Yamaha calls this "CP3" (Crossplane 3). But this is the typical and
    traditional 3 cylinder setup.
  - All Yamaha triples use this setup.
  - The branding matches CP2 (their 270deg twin) and CP4 (a crossplane 4
    engine) that Yamaha sells.
  - The firing interval is an even 240deg. The first cylinder fires,
    then the third, then the second.
    - That is: 0-180 is cylinder 1 firing. 180-240 is silence. 240-420
      is cylinder 3 firing. 420-480 is silence. 480-660 is cylinder 2
      firing. And last 660-720 is silence.
    - Note: power delivery is not perfectly even, because there are
      moments when there are no power strokes occurring (180deg to
      240deg, 420deg to 480deg).
    - However, this is more even power delivery than any twin engine.
    - There is an even 60deg of silence between combustion cycles.
  - Perfect primary reciprocating balance is achieved.
  - I can also prove that secondary reciprocating balance is perfect.
    - Angles of 0,120,240 correspond to doubled angles of 0,240,120.
    - Thus, if we double the frequency, these angles get swapped, but
      their relative position stays the same.
    - Thus, by the same argument that primary forces are balanced, we
      argue that secondary forces are balanced.
    - Note that it doesn't work for tertiary forces; 0,120,240 become
      0,0,0 in the tripled frequency domain. Thus, tertiary imbalance is
      magnified by 3x in this engine.
    - But I don't believe there are any tertiary imbalances?
  - A 120deg triple will have some primary rotational imbalance.
    - The pivot point actually moves. And the magnitude of the
      rotational imbalance changes throughout the combustion cycle.
    - It is zero when central piston is at TDC.
    - But it is maximum when piston 1 (or 3) is at TDC. But note that
      the pivot point is _not_ at the center piston. It is in between
      the first and center piston.
    - It appears that a balance shaft is needed to even this out.
- Triumph
  - Trident 660, Speed Triple, and Street Triple have crank angles of
    120deg. We've already discussed that setup.
  - Tiger 850, 900, 1200 have "T-Plane."
  - T-Plane has crank angles of 0deg, 270deg, and 180deg.
  - Cylinder 1 fires 0-180deg. Then cylinder 3 fires 180-360deg. Then
    360-450deg is 90deg silence. Then cylinder 2 fires 450-630deg. Then
    630-720deg is 90deg of silence.
  - That gives firing intervals of 180-270-270.
    - Or: 0deg silence, 90deg silence, 90deg silence.
  - The engine loses primary and secondary balance.
    - There is not primary reciprocating balance. Two pistons are 180deg
      apart, but there is the third piston which is not balanced. So
      that piston will not be balanced.
    - For primary rotational balance, the two outer pistons form a
      rocking couple.
    - But, usefully, the primary rotational imbalance is about the
      central piston, which is helpful.
  - Why do this? And why only on the ADV bikes? The reason they say is
    that even power delivery can mean that the tire is constantly under
    power and breaks traction in dirt and starts to spin.
  - By giving a longer interval under no power, the tire can find
    traction, and then you give it a pulse of power.
  - It seems implausible, but this was established on earlier big-bang
    firing engines that are used in off-road motorsports.
  - The downside is greater vibration.
    - Which is why I think they don't use it on street bikes, where
      there is less benefit.
    - Higher vibration is presumably going to limit overall power.
  - Another benefit is that the sound is nice.
  - For this reason, twins with 270 crank throws are also popular
    off-road.
