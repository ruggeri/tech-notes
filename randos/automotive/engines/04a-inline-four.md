- Generally used for high revving, high horsepower machines.
- Kawisaki, Honda, and Suzuki all make supersports. Also BMW.
  - Ducati and Aprilia prefer V4s, which we'll talk about later.
  - Triumph builds threes.
- Fours generally are built when you want at least 100HP. Otherwise, you
  can achieve it with a twin.
  - To get this, presumably you're normally relying on the high revving
    of the engine to achieve greater HP. Thus, you'll tune it to produce
    peak torque high up in the rev range.
- Your typical design will have each cylinder offset by 180deg.
  - Thus, your firing interval is an even 180deg.
  - This should have perfect primary reciprocating balance, like the
    inline twin.
  - I believe you can eliminate the rocking, if the cylinders are at
    0deg, 180deg, 540deg, 360deg. They should have no moment about their
    center of mass.
    - The firing order is thus: 1-3-4-2.
    - You could easily design an engine which fires 1-2-4-3, which has
      been done. I think it would basically give the same result.
  - I believe you will still have secondary imbalance. This should be
    doubled.
    - I believe balance shafts are used on higher displacement engines
      for this reason.
- There is always one cylinder firing, but there is some pulsation in
  power delivery. That happens because the end of the power stroke
  delivers less power than the beginning.
  - But I think this is common to all engines with no more than 4
    cylinders.
  - Because there is always a cylinder firing, the exhaust note is very
    even. This gives a screaming sound at high RPM.
- Crossplane Design
  - Yamaha is the only one currently doing this for inline fours.
  - Crank angle is 90deg. So pistons are at 0deg, 270deg, 90deg, 180deg
    with respect to each other.
    - Cylinder 1 fires at 0 deg, cylinder 3 at 270deg, cylinder 2 at
      450deg, and cylinder 4 at 540deg.
    - Firing intervals are 270-180-90-180...
  - So let's talk balance. You should have primary reciprocating
    balance. But you should have rocking about the center of mass.
  - So you have two rocking couples.
    - But the outer couple is placed further away, so it has more of an
      impact.
    - You could add counterweights at ends of crankshaft to reduced (but
      not eliminate) this rocking couple. We talked about how you could
      do that with 180deg parallel twins.
    - Claims that a balance shaft is a better solution here because...
      Why?
  - In good news, you have less secondary imbalance than a flatplane I4.
    - That's because there is no net secondary force at 90deg/270deg.
    - So you only have two pistons (the ones at 0deg, 180deg)
      contributing to secondary imbalance.
    - But this is not much of a win, because secondary imbalances are
      already less important than primary imbalance.
  - Talks about big bang engines, which produce their torque/power
    during a short phase of the cycle. The bangs are placed closer
    together.
    - This typically increases vibrations and reduces maximum possible
      output.
    - He talks about the advantage. Which is that in extreme high-speed
      cornering, you're going to get recovery time during which the tire
      is not under power. That way you can regain traction.
    - The crossplane isn't as crazy as some I4s with even more absurd
      firing intervals. But it's on that spectrum.
    - The R6 doesn't use crossplane because the 600 class is not
      overpowered for the exit.
  - Basically, this like the bike will have more vibration, and this
    really only benefits you when pushing to the absolute limit in
    cornering.
  - Last, I believe this is why you only see this in the Yamaha R1,
    which makes like 160+ HP and is meant for racing.
