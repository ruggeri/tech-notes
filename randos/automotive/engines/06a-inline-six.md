- These appear to be most identified with BMW, which continued to focus
  on I6 even as other manufacturers made V6s because they package
  better.
- Simple design, because one cylinder head, one set of camshafts, one
  exhaust manifold.
- It has an even firing interval of 120deg. And there is 60deg of power
  stroke overlap.
- The inline six is two mirrored inline threes, which cancels the
  rotational imbalance of a single inline three.
- It's long. I think that makes it hard to achieve larger displacements.
