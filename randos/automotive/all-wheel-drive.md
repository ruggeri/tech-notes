## All Wheel Drive

- All wheel drive (AWD) means that power can be sent to all wheels.
- Cars are typically either RWD (typical of performance cars) or FWD
  (more common). Only one axle (two wheels) are powered.
- One way to achieve AWD is to assign an electric motor to each wheel.
  - Sometimes called individual wheel drive I think.
- Another way is to require the two axles to rotate at the same rate.
  This is basically a locked differential between axles.
  - You would still have differentials for the two wheels on each of the
    front and rear axles.
  - We know that a locked differential on a single axle is not good for
    cornering.
  - But apparently this is also bad across axles. One obvious problem
    would be if the tires/wheels were of different sizes.
  - Many "part-time" systems work this way. You enable them
    manually. This locks the center differential.
  - You're not supposed to do this if you will drive on pavement.
  - Systems like this are often billed as "4WD" or 4x4.
- Toyota RAV4 is a good example.
  - Non hybrid versions have an electromagnetic clutch that connects
    rear and front axles. Power can be sent to the rear as necessary.
  - A more sophisticated version on the Highlander has two clutches at
    the rear to allow power to be sent to either the left or right rear
    wheel.
  - The RAV4 Prime doesn't have a driveshaft to send power to the rear.
    It has electric motors at the rear. Under 15mph, these are always
    used. Above 15mph, they are used as the computer deems necessary.

- A second method is to use an open or limited-slip differential to
  connect the axles.
  - If using an open differential, then a loss of traction at _any_ tire
    will rob all torque at the three other wheels.
  - A limited-slip differential will limit this problem.
  - A system setup like this is sometimes called "full-time" 4WD, or
    AWD.
- An "on-demand" mode is also possible.
  - Here, the 2WD mode is the default.
  - But when the system detect slip, it switches to 4WD mode.
  - This could be via electronic detection and hydraulic actuation, or
    by a passive system.
- Many cars with a 4WD system will also let you drop into a lower gear
  when selecting 4WD.
  - This maximizes torque.
- Note about stopping
  - 4WD/AWD doesn't help with stopping. It helps with traction for
    acceleration (sending power from engine to wheels).
  - To get better traction for stopping, you need better tires. Also,
    you ideally have antilock brakes.
- A final note; an electronic AWD system could selectively apply
  _brakes_ to a spinning wheel. This would give transfer force to the
  wheel with traction.
  - For instance, a traction control system (which applies braking to a
    spinning wheel) could do this.
    - But they're really meant for stopping you from spinning out. I
      think they won't send too much power across from a spinning wheel
      to a firmly planted one.
  - Just a note, I think they do sell 4WD systems with open
    differentials on each axle, but that seems kind of useless.

  - Great demonstration of different 4WD setups.
  - So far: shows that front and rear axles need to turn at different
    rates, not just inside and outside wheels.
  - He first shows that, if you have open differentials on each axle,
    even with 4WD mode, you will have power shift from a wheel that's
    stuck to a wheel on the same axle that's in the air.
  - Worst case is if you have one wheel on each axle (normally opposite
    wheels) in the air.
    - Even locking the center differential wouldn't help.
  - If all differentials are open, as he demonstrates, a single wheel
    losing traction will sap all power.
  - But another problem can happen if both front wheels are in the air.
    With an open center differential, you'll transfer all power to the
    front. Now you don't have the power at the back to move forward.
  - So you also want a locking center differential.
  - He also shows windup.

## Locking Hubs

- Imagine driving the car in RWD mode.
- The front wheels need to rotate at different speeds (for turning).
- If this is a RWD only car, there typically isn't even a front axle!
  The front wheels can spin freely and independently.
- But let's go back to the 4WD. It will have a front axle. It might not
  have a differential at the front, though.
- You want to switch it from RWD to 4WD mode. The 4WD is going to lock
  the front and rear axles. Now all wheels are locked together.
- Question: if theres no differential up front, how do the front wheels
  navigate turns without binding in RWD mode?
- The answer is a **locking hub**. Normal mode is unlocked, and allows
  the front wheels to spin freely, as if they weren't even connected to
  a shared axle.
- But once you lock them, now you are in 4WD mode.
- In fact, even if there _is_ a front differential, you don't need to
  unnecessarily load it.
- This is the system on the Land Cruiser, for instance.
  - Land Cruiser is weird. You can turn the four wheel drive on with a
    button (H4). This is only for high gear ratio.
  - Once in H4 mode, to move into low gear 4WD, you need to move the
    transfer case shift lever.
  - It's a weird system. I believe it's designed for ease of switching
    between H2 and H4.
