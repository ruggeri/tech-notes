- Turbocharging is a compressor driven by exhaust gas. The turbine takes
  energy from the exhaust gas and uses it to drive a compressor to suck
  more air into the engine.
- Thus, it is harnessing waste heat. It is often used to achieve better
  efficiency.
- A supercharger is driven off a belt from the engine to run the
  compressor.
- Today, it can be electric, which means you might get the energy for
  free from regenerative braking.
- Turbochargers can improve efficiency, because they allow a
  manufacturer to produce more HP from a smaller engine. And the smaller
  engine, when not operating at high RPM or throttle can be more
  efficient than a larger engine.
- A turbo added to an engine of the same size should not improve
  efficiency. It should reach higher HP, but it will use more fuel as it
  sucks more air.
- The supercharger is driven by the engine, so it takes power from the
  engine. It is not going to improve efficiency.
- The last point is about turbo lag. The turbo charger has some inertia.
  As you floor the throttle, the engine is going to build pressure in
  the exhaust, which will then accelerate the turbocharger. But this can
  take some time, which is a delay. People feel like this feels
  disconnected from the driving experience.
