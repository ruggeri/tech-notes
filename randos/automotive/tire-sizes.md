## Wheel Size

- The most common street motorcycle wheel diameter is 17".
- Adventure bikes might have 18", 19", or even 21" wheels.
  - A larger wheel can bridge a fixed gap length with less of a drop in
    wheel height.
  - If you imagine a tiny wheel, it will always drop into any hole.
  - I believe that also, if you hit a bump, the bigger wheel will hit it
    "farther away". (Because radius of curvature is larger, slope is
    less).
  - That means there is more linear distance between the contact point
    and the bottom of the wheel. Which means the bump is spanned over a
    longer distance/time period.
- All Vespas roll on 12" wheels.
- Onyx RCR runs on 17" wheels. Didn't expect that!
- 18" wheels is pretty typical for cars (Toyota Camry and BMW M3 sedan).
  Even Rav4.
- Smaller wheel advantages?
  - A greater force is delivered by the wheel. Effectively, it is as if
    you are in a lower gear.
  - It looks like two wheels rolling at the same transverse velocity
    will have the same stored rotational kinetic energy regardless of
    diameter?
  - I imagine that steering a larger wheel left-or-right would be more
    difficult that steering a smaller wheel?

## Tire Names

- Here is an example tire name: "P 225 / 70 R 16 91S".
- The "225" part is the **width** of the tire in millimeters. Obviously,
  wider means more surface area meeting the ground, which means more
  traction.
- The "16" part means the **diameter** of the tire in _inches_.
  Hilariously, the units here (inches) don't match the width
  (millimeters).
- The "70" part is the **aspect ratio**.
  - A tire can fit a 16 inch wheel but have super big sidewalls, which
    creates a large tire area.
  - To calculate the sidewall size, you take the width (225mm) and
    multiply it by the aspect ratio (0.70). This gives a sidewall height
    of 154.
  - Generally smaller sidewall size gives better performance, but with a
    harsher ride.
- Those three numbers determine the _size_ of the wheel. The other
  numbers are not unimportant, but not about the size per se.
- Let's look at the other, more minor parts now:
  - The "P" means passenger. LT means light truck. T means temporary
    (spare). ST means special trailer (only for use on a trailer).
  - The "R" means radial construction. This is the most common kind.
    Other options are D or B (diagonal or bias). It has to do with the
    orientation of the cords that form the tire.
  - The 91 means the **load index**. This describes how much weight the
    tire can support.
  - The last letter "S" is the tire speed rating. "S" means it can go up
    to 112 mph.
