## Voltages and Frequencies

- Note these are _residential_ voltages.
  - For instance, in the US, there is 240V three-phase power, and 120V
    split-phase power to the home.
- United States and Canada
  - Electrical voltage is 120V. Frequency is 60Hz.
- Europe
  - Electrical voltage is 230V and 50Hz.
    - Britain was 240, Europe was 220V. They harmonized at 230V in 80s.
- Asia
  - China is 220V (old Europe) and 50Hz.
  - India follows Europe (230V 50Hz).
  - South Korea is 220V and 60Hz.
  - Japan is 100V. Half the country works on 50Hz (including Tokyo), and
    half the country works on 60Hz (Osaka, Kyoto)
  - Australia follows Europe (230V 50Hz)
- Notes
  - Most things that work at 230V will work at 220V or 240V. It's not
    normally problematic. Similarly 100V, 110V, and 120V are typically
    interchangeable.
  - Most equipment also doesn't really care 50Hz vs 60Hz. Wall clocks
    do, though.
  - Putting a US hairdryer in a European plug will consume too much
    amperage and power. Putting a European hairdryer in a US plug will
    just not get very hot.
  - Transformers for computers and USB powered devices will normally
    work throughout the world.

## Plugs

So, when traveling, you mostly just need to adapt _plugs_.

**United States and Canada**

- Type A is the standard two flat prong, and Type B is the three prong
  (earthed).

**Europe: Common Plug Types**

- C is two 4mm diameter prongs spaced ~19mm apart.
  - This is an ungrounded plug.
  - This is not a national plug, but designed to work throughout
    Continental Europe.
  - It is only supposed to pass small currents like 2.5A.
  - The Type C prongs are bent a little inward. This allows them to fit
    in a variety of hole diameters.
- F is an earthed connector.
  - This is the German plug often called "Schuko".
  - It has a circular recessed socket, and circular based plug.
  - It has two 4.8mm prongs set 19mm apart.
  - Ground is provided by a metal sheath with two notches at the top and
    bottom. These provide contact area for metal clips at the socket.
  - A C plug can be plugged into the center of an F socket. The C prongs
    are smaller (4mm) than the F socket prong-holes (4.8mm). Thus the
    fit is just a little loose.
    - Also, the lozenge shape of the Type C plug base means it isn't as
      well supported as the circular Type F base.
    - Grip is provided by Type C's flexible prong base.
  - An F socket cannot be plugged into C, because the prongs diameter is
    too great.
  - F is most common grounded plug type in Europe.
- Type E is very similar to F.
  - This is the French plug type.
  - It has the same two 4.8mm prongs, set the same 19mm distance apart.
  - However, it doesn't have the metal sleeve/clips for ground. The plug
    has a _hole_ which a ground pin from the wall socket can mate with.
  - A C plug can be plugged into an E socket. It's just a bit loose
    (Type C 4mm pins are a little small for 4.8mm socket holes, plug
    base is lozenge not circular).
- Type E/F plugs are made to fit both Type E and Type F sockets.
  - There is contact for the ground both at the edges and a center hole
    for the E socket ground pin.
  - The fit is very good in Type E and Type F sockets.
  - This is a good solution and also provides grounding.
- C and F countries
  - Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Austria, Greece, Baltics,
    Balkans, Nordics, ...
- C and E countries
  - France, Belgium, Poland, Czechia, Slovakia

**Europe: Other National Plugs**

- United Kingdom, Ireland (G)
  - G is for the UK. It has two parallel blades for live and neutral,
    and a third blade at a right angle for the ground.
  - All UK sockets offer grounding. Plugs that don't need ground can
    have a plastic ground pin.
- Italy (C, F, and L)
  - L is used only in Italy (okay also Albania).
  - The typical plug is the 10A plug. It has 4mm prongs, set 19mm
    apart.
    - These outlets are typically not recessed.
    - Type E/F plugs cannot be plugged into a Type L 10A outlet. The
      4.8mm prongs are too big.
    - However, the Type C Europlug fits nicely.
    - CEI 23-50 S 10 is the two-prong unearthed plug.
    - CEI 23-50 S 11 is the three prong earthed plug.
    - I have seen this kind. I couldn't plug my Type E/F in, naturally.
  - The 16A Italian Type L has 5mm prongs, set 26mm apart.
    - These outlets are typically not recessed.
    - This socket doesn't accept Italian Type L 10A plugs (those pins
      are spaced 19mm apart).
    - Likewise, the 16A Type L socket can't accept Type E/F plugs
      (pin/hole diameter basically matches, but Type E/F pins are spaced
      19mm apart).
    - CEI 23-50 S 16 is the two prong unearthed plug.
    - CEI 23-50 S 17 is the three prong earthed plug.
    - In Venice I never saw this kind (to my recollection)
  - It is common to have Italian sockets that accept both 10A and 16A
    Type L (and also Europlug). This is called "Bipasso".
    - These have a central hole for ground.
    - They then have two "figure eight" holes. Each figure eight has a
      pair of (overlapping) holes. These allow 19mm and 26mm spaced
      prongs to both plug in.
    - Note that the holes set 26mm apart are bigger (5mm) than those
      set 19mm apart (4mm).
    - This can of course accept Type C.
    - This style still cannot accept Type E/F though. Those 4.8mm
      prongs are too big to fit into the 4mm Type L holes set 19mm
      apart. Also, it would not be safe, since the pins of Type E/F
      are not sheathed.
    - I saw this kind also. I again could not plug my Type E/F plug in.
  - There is also a modification of Schuko that adds a central ground
    hole and thus supports Type E/F and also Type L 10A and 16A. It is
    basically bipasso with 4.8mm and 5mm holes, and a circular body.
    - This is becoming the standard in Italy.
    - Not sure if I saw this, or just a normal German Type E in Venice
      hotel bathroom. It accepted my Type E/F plug, anyway.
- Denmark (C and K)
  - K is same circular shape as E and F. But the plug has a ground pin
    in a location similar to the American B type ground pin.
  - The prongs are again 4.8mm diameter and set at the same 19mm
    distance as Type E/F plugs.
  - You can use Type C Europlug. It will fit, but a little loosely, as
    usual.
  - You can plug in Type E and F plugs, but any ground will not connect.
  - You cannot plug a Type K plug into an E/F outlet, because the
    ground prong is not accepted by those outlets.
- Switzerland (C and J)
  - Type J has three prongs, each 4mm diameter. The neutral/live
    prongs are set 19mm apart. A third (ground) prong is located
    offset in a triangular pattern (similar to Danish or American
    grounded plugs).
  - Thus, a Type C plug will fit into a Swiss Type J outlet nicely. It
    will not provide grounding, of course.
  - The plug base is lozenge shaped, and the outlet is typically
    recessed.
  - Technically there are 10A and 16A versions. The 16A version has
    squarish pins. However, 16A sockets will also accept standard 10A
    plugs.

**Asia**

- Japan already uses A and B plug types. No conversion is needed.
- Korea uses Type F.

## Converters

- I have this worldwide converter set:
  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DQDD18X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1
- I like that it has two American grounded outlets, plus two USB
  charging outlets.
- I like that the back is interchangeable.
- I prefer using the Type E/F circular plugs, or three-prong Type L
  plugs, because they have more points of contact and fit more securely
  to the outlet.
- I suspect I would have trouble using a Type C plug in Type E/F
  outlets, because the plug tends to rotate out of the outlet. Also, I
  want grounding if possible.
- I don't like using crazy universal adapters because they seem to make
  poor electrical contact. I had trouble with this in Japan and Korea.
- Also, the Type A wall-mounted Apple charger is not good, because it
  tends to want to rotate out of the socket. I prefer using a Type B
  (American grounded 3-prong) cord, and letting the transformer body
  rest on the floor.
