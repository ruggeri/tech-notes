## Priority

* Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Norvig, Russell)
* Probabilistic Robotics
* ElasticSearch in Action
* Intro To Linear Algebra (Strang)

## All Books

* Algorithm Design (Tardos)
    * Did read. Could have a useful chapter on local search which I
      skipped at the time.
* Amazon Web Services in Action
    * **TODO**
* An Introduction to Statistical Learning
    * Doesn't really feel essential.
* Approximation Algorithms (Vazirani)
    * Did not read.
    * This collects algorithms to a variety of problems. Not really
      interesting from a general learning standpoint.
* Art of Electronics
    * Did not read.
    * I just don't understand electronics that well. This book is too
      hard, and it's not really in the wheelhouse of my interest area.
    * *Low Priority*.
* Art of Multiprocessor Programming
    * Did skim. Lots of useful details, but I know most of this stuff
      now.
    * Has interesting stuff on hardware and cache-consistency.
* Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Norvig, Russell)
    * Not very hard, but covers a bunch of intro stuff. Broad, not
      deep.
    * **High priority**.
* Big Data: Principles and Best Practices of Scalable Real-time Data
  Systems (Marz)
    * Did read. It's okay. I think he makes it sound like Lambda
      Architecture solves everything, but actually it sounds like lack
      of transactionality continues to suck and add ridiculous
      complexity.
    * Did have useful stuff on message queues, and how they play a
      role. Gives a sense of how Storm and Cassandra might be used.
* Bitcoin for the Befuddled
    * Read whole thing. Good introduction; fun!
* Causality (Pearl)
    * Started. Very hard and not directly related to standard AI/ML
      techniques.
    * At work.
    * Very low priority.
* Compilers (Aho)
    * Very good. Working through this presently.
* Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective
    * Don't own this anymore. Really enjoyed back in college.
* C++: Concurrency in Action
    * Did skim. I think I actually know all the stuff in this. Has
      some good C++ implementation stuff about concurrent
      datastructures, but I already wrote up all that stuff.
* Database Systems (Garcia-Molina)
    * Did read. Good stuff on implementation of DBs.
    * Also had good stuff about theory of relational data; I had read
      that years ago.
    * Even the parallel DB stuff is pretty good.
* Designing Data-Intensive Applications
    * Love it. Everything I want to talk about and cover in my
      architecture lecture series.
* Distributed Algorithms (Lynch)
    * Started. The style here is pretty brutal. Totally comprehensive.
    * I feel like I'm not super-interested in the theory of
      distributed algorithms, so maybe I'm okay letting this go.
    * I think between Coulouris and maybe Tanenbaum I'm okay.
    * Also, I think I'm burning out on distributed DBs. I think
      whitepapers are more useful to me now.
    * Low priority.
* Distributed Systems (Coulouris)
    * Ch10 P2P. Ch12 Distributed FS. Read Ch14-18: clocks
      coordination, concurrency control, distributed transactions, and
      replication.
    * Started this. Poorly written, sort of a litany of algorithms.
    * *Low priority*.
* Distributed Systems (Tanenbaum)
    * I'd like to skim this just to check it out.
    * **Medium priority**
* Div Grad Curl And All That
    * Didn't read. I can review this if I really need it...
* ElasticSearch in Action
    * Just want to know how this works.
    * **High priority**
* Elements of Computing Systems
    * Loaned to Stefano.
    * Did read; great book. Most of it I already know, but stuff about
      boolean circuits, and also memory (implemented as delay) was
      fascinating.
* Elements of Statistical Learning (Friedman, Hastie, Tibrishani)
    * Did not read (started first couple chapters).
    * Really hard, should do Strang and Norvig AI first.
    * Also: has a bunch of stuff on trees.
    * Probably would prefer Murphy.
    * *Very low priority*.
* Exploring Arduino
    * **TODO**
* Intro to Algorithms (CLRS)
    * Did skim; read some parts careful for a few things I hadn't seen.
    * Great resource, but I already know everything I need from here.
* Intro To Linear Algebra (Strang)
    * I kinda know most of this, but I also need to learn PCA and SVD.
    * **High priority**.
    * I have this at home safe and sound!
* Learning Spark
    * Did read. Quick 1-day read describing Spark.
    * Generally pretty good. Not earth shattering.
* Machine Learning (Mitchell)
    * This looks like the least interesting of the ML books I own. I
      don't hear a lot of great things about it.
    * *Low priority*.
* Machine Learning (Murphy)
    * Looks like a great book. Very comprehensive; covers
      *everything*.
    * Except it cheaps out on NNs. Meh.
    * After Norvig, this should come next.
    * **High priority**.
* Make: Electronics
    * **TODO**
* Make: More Electronics
    * **TODO**
* Mastering Web Application Development with AngularJS
    * This was a shit book, and I moved on to React.
* MongoDB in Action
    * **TODO**
* Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Bishop)
    * Did not read.
    * Definitely a widely used book, but Murphy seems more friendly to
      me.
    * *Low priority*.
* Practical Electronics for Inventors
    * **TODO**
* Principles of Distributed Database Systems
    * Pretty poor book that does a bad job of explaining things.
    * Good citations though, and at least surfaces a lot of things to
      think about.
    * Bernstein's (now free) book Concurrency Control and Recovery in
      DB Systems might have been more interesting to me...
    * Only read through Ch14 (Parallel DB), as the rest wasn't that
      interesting to me.
* Probabilistic Graphical Models (Koller)
    * Skimmed most of this book. The PGM course covered most of this.
    * Wouldn't hurt to re-skim through it to make sure I didn't miss
      anything.
    * *Low priority*.
* Probabilistic Robotics
    * Haven't looked through this!
    * *TODO priority*.
* Programing Arduino: Getting Started
    * **TODO**
* Programming Arduino: Next Steps
    * **TODO**
* Programming Collective Intelligence (Segaran)
    * Haven't looked through this!
    * *TODO priority*.
* Programming in Scala
    * Owned this book once before. So far has nothing that wasn't
      covered in online documentation. Uninsightful; prolly waste of
      money.
* Purely Functional Datastructures
    * Exhausted this book mostly. Prolly have done enough persistent
      algorithms for a lifetime.
    * Maybe it's because I don't know ML, but I didn't find this book
      amazingly useful.
* Quantum Computation and Quantum Information (Nielsen and Chaung)
    * Too hard for me to understand this very well right now.
    * Honestly, I probably don't need to know this.
    * Very low priority.
* Quantum Computing Since Democritus (Aaronson)
    * Very enjoyable. Learned a lot of random stuff.
    * Am pretty stuck on the quantum stuff. Nielsen/Chaung might have
      helped; could try to get unstuck.
    * Low Priority.
* Randomized Algorithms (Motwani and Raghavan)
    * Looks to be more technical and detailed than I care about.
* Real World Haskell
    * Pretty shit book. Ch14,15,18 are all about monads, might be
      worth it. Ch24 and 28 and are about parallel programming and
      STM.
    * But honestly I don't care, and I doubt this would help.
* Redis in Action
    * Have started reading this. Pretty shitty, actually. Using Redis
      just feels really ugly and hacky. Do not like.
* Structure and Interpreation of Computer Programs
    * Just wasn't that interesting. Probably came too late to
      influence my thinking.

## Books To Maybe Buy

**Interesting**

* OpenCL in Action
    * It seems like maybe people like CUDA better?
* RxJS in Action
    * Don't know very much about reactive programming. Kind of a weak
      spot.
    * But it's not done yet!
* Taming Text
    * Looks like it might have some interesting stuff related to text
      search that I think I know, but might want to check on.
    * **At the office**

**Uninteresting**

* Effective Modern C++
    * I think I already covered this in my notes on C++11, so not
      vitally important.
    * Likewise, I don't think Effective C++ (Meyers) or Modern C++
      (Alexandrescu) is that necessary, since I know C++ pretty okay
      and don't use it professionally.
    * If I were to start doing C++ profesionally, these might be worth
      picking up. Maybe just Modern C++, the others are really just
      summaries of C++ it lookslike...
* Java Concurrency in Practice
    * Used to own this. Already familiar with these concepts; would
      only be worth it if I started doing concurrent Java programming.
    * I hope that doesn't happen.
