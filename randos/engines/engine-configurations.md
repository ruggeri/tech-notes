## Engine Power

- Engine displacement
  - Number of cylinders: more means more power.
  - Size of each cylinder
    - Stroke length: how long each piston travels
    - Bore: diameter of cylinder
- Compression ratio
- Maximum RPM
  - Typically can be greater for smaller cylinders. That's because a
    piston head needs to accelerate from high speed to a dead stop, and
    that puts stress on the connecting rods. The connecting rods want to
    be torn apart. The problem is worse at high RPMs, and for heavy
    pistons.
  - So an engine with more but smaller cylinders can achieve higher RPM
    for a given displacement.
- Fueling
  - More cylinders also means more fuel injectors and valves, which
    means you can give more fuel to the engine.

## Engine Configurations

**Single (AKA Thumper)**

- Simpler than multi-piston engines.
- Smaller displacement, usually less power, but also lower weight, and
  smaller volume.
- You can increase RPM to increase power, but that tends to wear the
  engine out faster.
  - If you do higher RPMs, you need stronger connecting rods, for
    instance. Because the pistons are going to pull trying to tear
    them apart.
  - KTM makes a thumper that does 77hp. But that's not enough for most
    people on the highway.
- Can sometimes get away with air cooling because air isn't blocked
  from any of the cylinders.
- They have pulsing power delivery and a lot of vibration.
  - This is because the engine is not _balanced_. We'll talk more
    about that later.
- To even out power pulsation, they'll use a larger than typical
  _flywheel_. The flywheel stores power as rotational inertia.
  - Note that the pulsation will also get worse as you increase stroke
    or bore. That's another limit on the displacement.
- To even out vibration, you can start adding _balance shafts_ to
  counteract vibrations. But soon enough it will be easier to build a
  multi-cylinder engine.
- Single cylinder tends to be more fuel efficient. But is that just
  because it is lower power?
- At same displacement, will make more low-end torque than a twin?
  - **TODO**: Why??

**Inline-Twin**

- Also called: "straight-twin," "vertical-twin," "parallel-twin."
- Two cylinders that are mounted side-by-side.
- Typically transverse mounted. Cylinders are side-by-side,
  perpendicular to the bike. Crank runs perpendicular to the bike axis.
  - Only 1 motorcycle ever did a straight twin longitudinal.
- Popular with Honda, Kawasaki, Yamaha.
- Are typically more compact and easier to design than flat-twins or
  V-twins.
- Crankshaft angle
  - 360deg: both pistons move together.
    - Some people use "parallel twin" to refer specifically to this
      crankshaft angle.
    - Firing is offset by 360deg.
  - 180deg: pistons are always opposite to each other.
    - Some people use "vertical twin" to refer specifically to this
      crankshaft angle.
    - My Ninja 650 has a 180deg angle, but Kawasaki calls it
      "parallel" anyway.
    - Firing of second cylinder is 180deg after first, but then you wait
      another 540deg until the first cylinder fires again.
  - 270deg: pistons are offset by 90deg.
    - Some people say this ends up being similar to a V-Twin.
    - The Aprilia Tuono 660 has this configuration.
- Can be prone to vibration either because (1) unbalanced mass in the
  360deg version or (2) irregular firing in the 180deg version.

**Flat Twin**

- This is typical of BMW motorcycles.
- Two cylinders are opposed 180 degrees across the crankshaft.
- Typically longitudinal mounted.
  - Means crank runs parallel to bike axis. Cylinders stick out
    perpendicular from the bike.

**V-Twin**

- Typical of Aprilia, Ducati, Harley, Suzuki. Some Hondas.
- Mostly transverse, though Moto Guzzi does longitudinal mounting.
- Ducati V-twin is 90deg and mounted with one cylinder pointing
  almost forward; they thus call it L-Twin.

**Triple**

- Almost always 120deg offset.
- Extremely unusual to have 180deg offset (2 together, 1 apart).
- Will typically be mounted transverse. The headers will look like a
  trident.
- However, you can also have a longitudinal triple, where the
  cylinders run with the bike. This is the configuration of the
  Triumph Rocket 3.
- Most identified with Triumph. But also Yamaha makes some.

**Four cylinder**

- Inline four
  - Flat plane: 180deg offset.
  - Crossplane: each 90deg offset. Only Yamaha on the YZF-R1
    literbike.
- V4
