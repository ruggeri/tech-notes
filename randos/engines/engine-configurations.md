- Single
- Twin
  - Cylinder orientation
    - "Inline" twin or "straight" twin.
      - Two cylinders that are mounted side-by-side.
      - Typically transverse mounted. Cylinders are side-by-side,
        perpendicular to the bike. Crank runs perpendicular to the bike
        axis.
        - Only 1 motorcycle ever did a straight twin longitudinal.
      - Popular with Honda, Kawasaki, Yamaha.
    - Flat twin
      - This is typical of BMW motorcycles.
      - Two cylinders are opposed 180 degrees across the crankshaft.
      - Typically longitudinal mounted.
        - Means crank runs parallel to bike axis. Cylinders stick out
          perpendicular from the bike.
    - V-twin
      - Typical of Aprilia, Ducati, Harley, Suzuki. Some Hondas.
      - Mostly transverse, though Moto Guzzi does longitudinal mounting.
      - Ducati V-twin is 90deg and mounted with one cylinder pointing
        almost forward; they thus call it L-Twin.
  - Crankshaft angle
    - 360deg: both pistons move together.
      - Some people use "parallel twin" to refer specifically to this
        crankshaft angle.
    - 180deg: pistons are always opposite to each other.
      - Some people use "vertical twin" to refer specifically to this
        crankshaft angle.
      - My Ninja 650 has a 180deg angle, but Kawasaki calls it
        "parallel" anyway.
    - 270deg: pistons are offset by 90deg.
      - Some people say this ends up being similar to a V-Twin.
      - The Aprilia Tuono 660 has this configuration.
- Triple
  - Almost always 120deg offset.
  - Extremely unusual to have 180deg offset (2 together, 1 apart).
  - Will typically be mounted transverse. The headers will look like a
    trident.
  - However, you can also have a longitudinal triple, where the
    cylinders run with the bike. This is the configuration of the
    Triumph Rocket 3.
  - Most identified with Triumph. But also Yamaha makes some.
- Four cylinder
  - Inline four
    - Flat plane: 180deg offset.
    - Crossplane: each 90deg offset. Only Yamaha on the YZF-R1
      literbike.
  - V4
