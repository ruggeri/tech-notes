* Proof of stake
    * Delegated proof of stake
* Dapps (Ethereum smart contracts?)
* Zcash: how does that work?

## Largest Currencies

* Bitcoin $141B
* Ethereum $47B
    * Faster blocks.
    * Can write arbitrary code.
* Ripple $18B
    * Consensus algorithm. Doesn't mine.
    * High tx rate, low energy use, low transaction cost.
* Bitcoin Cash $14B
    * Fork that increased block size to 8MB.
* EOS $7.7B
    * Seems like it is similar to ETH.
    * Uses proof of stake.
* Stellar $6.5B
    * Allows transfer of real world currencies?
    * I'm confused how this works.
* Litecoin $5B
    * Uses scrypt, which is memory hard.
    * Intent is to thrawt ASIC mining.

    * Looks again like ETH but with proof of stake.
* IOTA
    * People seem to think this is a scam.
    * Not sure what it is supposed to offer.
* Tether
    * Supposed to be a "stablecoin."
    * I think the idea is that they keep dollars somewhere.

* TRON
    * Something about a payment system for content.
* Monero
    * Uses "ring signatures" to hide where funds are going.
    * Also uses some kind of ASIC resistant hashing method.
* NEO
    * Like ETH but using proof of stake.
* Dash
    * Has some kind of distributed method of decision making about the
      future of the currency.
    * Faster block interval. Some anonymity.
* ZCash
    * More privacy by use of zero knowledge proof.
