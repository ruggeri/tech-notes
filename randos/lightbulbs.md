## Measurements

- Wattage is the power consumption.
  - 60W incandescent bulbs were the norm for a long time.
- Lumens is the light output.
  - A 60W incandescent bulb put out 800 lumens.
  - A 100W incandescent bulb put out 1600 lumens (twice as bright).
- Temperature is the color of the light, varying from yellow
  - 3000K is the peak of "warm white."
    - Below 3000K is getting possibly too yellow.
    - We tend to like ~3000K lights.
  - 3500K-4200K is getting toward cool but not blue white.
  - 5000K+ is now gaining a bluish tone.

## Illumination Technologies

- Incandescent
  - This is the standard, but gets hot, limiting the lumens output.
  - You can get way higher lumens with LEDs.
  - Also, they are wasteful in energy.
- Halogen
  - About 20% more efficient than incandescent. Tungsten filament is
    surrounded by a halogen gas.
- Compact Fluorescent Lamp
  - Basically like a long fluorescent tube but wound so that it can fit
    in a typical bulb format.
  - About 80% more efficient than incandescent.
  - LEDs are a fair bit more efficient, and less toxic.
- LED
  - Best in efficiency. Can have very high lumen outputs for very low
    power.
  - Heat is not a problem.

## Bulb Shapes

- First, you have the base. E26 is the standard Edison screw size in the
  United States.
  - Smaller edison bases might be used in Christmas lights or candelabra
    settings. E27 (wider) is used in Europe but not the US, thank god.
- Next, there is the bulb's maximum diameter. A21 is a big bulb, which
  usually fits in single-bulb appliances.
  - A19 is a smaller size sometimes used for multi-bulb appliances like
    my tripod lamp.
  - Actually, A19 is the _typical_ size, and A21 is a bit bigger. A19 is
    sometimes called A60 (because it is 60mm diameter at maximum).
- I have used a few weird ones:
  - PAR (parabolic aluminized reflector) are parabolic lamps meant for
    directional light. I have a PAR38 bulb in Pablo. These were
    typically used for outdoor security flood lighting. They were often
    halogen to boost the lumens. Now they can be LED.
  - I've bought G25 globe-shaped bulbs that are decorative and used in a
    bathroom vanity.
  - Last, there are MR (multifaceted reflector) which are primarily used
    for track lighting (such as in my kitchen). These tend to use GU5.3
    bases (two prong connectors), rather than Edison. GU5.3 is sometimes
    called "bipin" and is used for low voltage and low power fittings.

## Light Placement

- Overhead lighting is very valuable, because we want to look down at
  surfaces like a desk.
  - However, many older apartments do not have ceiling mounted light
    fixtures, or these are of inferior quality.
- Lamps where the bulb is mounted high tend to be superior.
- A long lamp shade with a bulb at the middle will be fairly dark at
  both ends, and radiates light mostly from the center.
- I have eschewed desk lamps, but this may not have been wise. Desk
  lamps provide very direct light to where you are working.
- Similarly, you can place a table lamp on a shelf, which provides
  elevated lighting.
