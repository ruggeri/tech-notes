Our fuse box contains six screw-in fuse circuits. Most cartridges in
there are 15A or 20A.

The original style of fuses were Type T. But 15A, 20A and 30A fuses
could all be installed in the same outlets. That means it is easy to
"overfuse" a circuit: use a fuse that passes more amperage than that
circuit should allow.

The Type T fuse size is the same Edison thread as lightbulb outlets.

Type S fuses have different shapes depending for each of the 15A, 20A
and 30A ratings. You're supposed to install - permanently - a Type S
adapter into the panel. The adapter is specific to the appropriate fuse
amperage for the circuit. This adapter will only allow the appropriate
rated fuse to be screwed in. I believe that Type S fuses can only be
installed into a Type S adapter - the gauge of the threads looks totally
different to me.

Type TL or SL means a "time delayed" fuse (of type T or S as described
above). They will not blow right away if too much current is drawn; they
allow excess current to pass for a brief period. This is necessary often
for connecting motors to power, since they draw large currents on
startup when the motor is not yet rotating.

I believe that SL fuses are the standard one you want to use most of the
time.
