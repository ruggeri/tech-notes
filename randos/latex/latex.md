TODOS:

* Latex 2e Unofficial Manual (183 pages)
* IEEEeqnarray docs.
* graphicx
* bibtex

I think also that a *TeX* resource is also important. Stuff like
`\expandafter` and `\csname` come from TeX, not LaTeX.

I believe the proper resource for this is the TeX book!

## Randos

* I saw the `\rlap{xyz}` command. It basically puts `xyz` in a
  zero-width box, allowing to overlap with whatever is to the right.
  This can be helpful for alignment in array-type environments, if you
  want some overlap of columns.
