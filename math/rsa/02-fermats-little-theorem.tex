\section{Fermat's Little Theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Fermat's Little Theorem]
  For any $a \ne 0$:

  \begin{nedqn}
    a^p = a \mod p
  \end{nedqn}

  Equivalently:

  \begin{nedqn}
    a^{p-1} = 1 \mod p
  \end{nedqn}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Fermat's little theorem is simply a special case of Lagrange's
  theorem.

  As mentioned in the last section, we already showed that the series
  $1, a, a^2, \ldots$ generates a subgroup of $\Zmodpx$ (the
  multiplicative subgroup of $\Zmodp$).

  By applying Lagrange's theorem, we showed that the order of the
  generated subgroup divides $p - 1$ (the size of the multiplicative
  subgroup).

  But then we have that if $k \order{a} = p - 1$ (for some $k$), then:

  \begin{nedqn}
    a^{p - 1}
  \eqcol
    a^{k\order{a}}
  \\
  \eqcol
    \parens{
      a^{\order{a}}
    }^k
  \\
  \eqcol
    1^k
  \\
  \eqcol
    1
  \end{nedqn}

  Again, we note that the order of $a$ may well be less than $p - 1$ (in
  which case $k > 1$). Regardless, we will still have that $a^{p - 1} =
  1$.
\end{proof}
