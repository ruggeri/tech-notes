\section{Proposition}

\begin{theorem}[Finite Dimensional Spectral Theorem]
  For any full-rank real symmetric matrix $\mtxA$, there exists an
  orthogonal (aka ``rotation'') matrix $\mtxQ$ and a diagonal (aka
  ``stretching'') matrix $\mtxD$ such that:

  \begin{nedqn}
    \mtxA
  & = &
    \mtxQDQt
  \end{nedqn}

  Equivalently: any full-rank real symmetric matrix $\mtxA$ with
  dimension $n$ possesses $n$ orthogonal (unit) eigenvectors $\setof{
  \vecu[1], \ldots \vecu[n] }$. That is, for suitable $\lambda_i$:

  \begin{nedqn}
    \mtxA\vecu[i]
  & = &
    \lambda_i \vecu[i]
  \end{nedqn}

  Note that if we have $\mtxQ$, we can obtain a set $\vecu[i]$ by
  extracting the columns. Alternatively, given $\vecu[i]$ we can
  produce $\mtxQ$ by writing them in as columns.
\end{theorem}
