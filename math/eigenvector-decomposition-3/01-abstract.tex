\section{abstract}

This proof tries to correct my original ``proof.'' JRN pointed out the
error in my proof to me and gave me an alternative one. His proof uses
the extreme value theorem for a continuous function defined on a compact
domain. His proof takes a slightly different approach than my original,
though. This document is an attempt to import his idea (using the
extreme value theorem) to correct my original version, while staying
true to the intuition/idea I had been pursuing.
