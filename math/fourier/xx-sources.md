* I also really liked "Fourier Analysis" by Gerald B. Folland.

In Folland, there is a very readable treatment of when the Fourier
seriers and Fourier transforms exist and converge back to the original
function. It involves a bunch of Lebesgue integration theorems (some
of which I wrote up in the calculus folder).

But I don't really care about being that technical. I feel the writeup
I have given (especially regarding "relative masses" and the
correction factor) are sufficient for me to know I understand things.
