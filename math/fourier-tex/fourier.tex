% The basis of sine functions is sufficient to span cosines, as any cosine
% function may be written as a phase-shifted sine function.

% We want not only finite linear combinations of basis vectors, but we
% also want *infinite linear combinations*. We want to consider the basis
% as a *topological basis*, rather than merely an *algebraic basis*. But
% we'll consider that later...

% In conclusion, the basis is orthonormal. The projection operation
% continues to be linear. Therefore, we have that the basis is
% algebraically independent. (Even better, if we consider the topology
% induced by the inner product, the basis is topologically independent,
% too).

% ## L2 Inner Product Intuition

% Let me try to give some intuitive pictures for why the integral inner
% product is natural.

% Recall that the standard inner product in `R^n` (the dot product) is
% correct if you want to decompose a vector `u` into (1) a component along
% `v`, and (2) a component in the rank `n-1` space "orthogonal" to `v`.
% This "orthogonal" notion presupposes the concept of rotation of basis
% vectors.

% We can see functions on `R` as an extension to this. Especially if we
% restrict to functions that are the (pointwise?) convergence of step
% functions.

% One could say: in `R^n` we had the notion that we could always "keep
% rotating" and eventually end up back at the starting vector. So that
% suggests that our basis vectors ought to be all "translates" of each
% other, with respect to rotation. But that is also a little odd: in `R^n`
% there are `n-1` angles that define a unit vector, whereas if we choose
% the Fourier basis for functions on `R` there is only one continuous
% variable of rotation...

% A "statistics" view is that you are asking for the "correlation" between
% `u` and `v`. In that setting, the inner product makes sense.

% **TODO**: clarify these random, still un-unified and incomplete thoughts
% into a more coherent story.
