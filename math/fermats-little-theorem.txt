## Statement

Fermat's little theorem says:

    a^p = a (mod p)

Alternatively,

    a^{p-1} = 1 (mod p)

## Binomial Theorem Proof

I read this on Wolfram. It is inductive. Note the statement is true
for `a = 1` of course.

Use the Binomial Theorem:

    (a + 1)^p = (p choose p) a^p + (p choose p-1) a^{p-1} + ...
                (p choose 1) a + (p choose 0) 1

Note all the coefficients have the form:

     p! / (k! (p-k)!)

For any `k` not equal to zero or `p`, then necessarily this is
divisible by `p`.

So we can say:

   (a + 1)^p = a^p + 1 (mod p)

But here we use the inductive hypothesis, that `a^p = 1 (mod p)`.

So we have

   (a + 1)^p = a + 1 (mod p)

Done!

## Ned Proof

By pigeon hole, we know that the series `a^k (mod p)` eventually must
enter a cycle. The question is whether `a` is part of the cycle.

One way to enter a "cycle" is if `a^k = 0 (mod p)`. But that would
mean `xy = 0 (mod p)` for `x = a^{k - 1}` and `y=a`. In fact, for any
`x, y` this cannot be true unless `x = 0 (mod p)` or `y = 0 (mod
p)`. For consider that `x` and `y` can both be written with prime
factorization, and since both are `<p`, that prime is not featured. So
it's not featured in their product. So their product cannot be zero
mod `p`.

Great. But what if the series is like: `a, a^2, a^3, ..., b, ...,
b`? That is, it's like a linear progression, and then it hits `b`,
which is part of a loop. I want to show that can't happen.

This can only occur if `b a^k = b (mod p)` for some `k>0`. How could
this happen?

Note: we can assume:

* `b != 0 (mod p)`, for reason given above,
* `b != 1 (mod p)`, because that's what we're trying to prove.
* `a^k != 1 (mod p)` because that's what we're trying to prove.

So the last case is like so:

   xy = x (mod p)

for some `x != 0 (mod p)`, `y != 1 (mod p)`. But then note:

    x(y - 1) = 0 (mod p)

By the preceding argument, we said this cannot happen unless one of
`x` and `y-1` are zero mod `p`. We already said that `b != 0 (mod
p)`. Which means `y-1 = 0 (mod p)`, i.e. `y = 1 (mod p)`. And that is
what I wanted to show.

## Ned Proof Continued

I have showed that repeated multiplication does eventually bring you
back to `a (mod p)`. But what if the length of that loop is *not* `p`?
Of course it must be at *most* `p`, but could it be less?

**TODO**

## Euler's Totient Theorem

* a^{phi(n)} = 1 (mod n)
* Where `phi(n)` is the number of coprime numbers `<=n`.
  * Note the `<=n`.
* Note that `phi(p) = p-1` for any prime `p`.
  * Note that `p - phi(p)` is the number of not-coprime numbers `<=n`.
* If `n=pq`, where both prime, then totient is equal to
  `(p-1)*(q-1)`. Why?
  * Consider the number of not-coprimes.
  * This is `p, 2p, ..., (q-1)p`.
  * And also `q, 2q, ..., (p-1)q`.
  * And finally: `pq`.
  * Alternatively, `q + p - 1` (because overcounting).
* But note that this is exactly `pq - (p-1)(q-1)`. Expand the terms.
  * This shows that `phi(pq) = (p-1)(q-1)`.
