## Statement

Fermat's little theorem says:

    a^p = a (mod p)

Equivalently,

    a^{p-1} = 1 (mod p)

## Binomial Theorem Proof

I read this on Wolfram. It is inductive. Note the statement is true
for `a = 1` of course.

Use the Binomial Theorem:

    (a + 1)^p = (p choose p) a^p + (p choose p-1) a^{p-1} + ...
                (p choose 1) a + (p choose 0) 1

Note all the coefficients have the form:

     p! / (k! (p-k)!)

For any `k` st `0<k<p`, then necessarily this is divisible by `p`.

So we can say:

   (a + 1)^p = a^p + 1 (mod p)

But here we use the inductive hypothesis, that `a^p = 1 (mod p)`.

So we have

   (a + 1)^p = a + 1 (mod p)

Done!

## Permutations proof

We know that 1a, 2a, 3a, ..., is just a permutation of 1, 2, 3,
... Therefore we know that:

    (p-1)! = 1a * 2a * 3a ... * (p-1)a

Where the right side is permuted somehow. But this is:

    (p-1)! = (p-1)! a**(p-1)

Cancelation says:

    a**(p-1) = 1.

Donezo.

## Combinatorics

Consider necklaces of length p, where there are `a` choices of beads
at each spot. There are a**p necklaces. Of these, a of them are
constant color. Every other necklace of has p equivalent permutations.

That means that (a**p - a) is divisible by p. That means:

    a**p = a.


## Lagrange's Theorem

In *any* group (not just Z mod p), we have that the order of a
subgroup divides the order of the group. For consider the subgroup
`A`. Then consider every *coset*

    bA

The size of `bA` is equal to `A`, since we can always invert with
`b**-1 bA`.

The `bA` do not partially overlap. Otherwise:

    b_0 a_0 = b_1 a_1

But this means that `b_1 = b_0 a_0 a_1**-1`. But that means that `b_1`
was in the coset `b_0 A` from before. Indeed any `b_1 a` can be
rewritten in terms of `b_0 a`.

This shows that the cosets partition `G` and thus the order of the
subgroup `A` divides the order of the group `G`.

I don't need primitive root theorem for this. It's true in any group.

## From primitive root theorem

See my z-mod-p document. We know any cyclic subgroup of a cyclic
parent group must have order dividing the order of the parent
group. And I show in the z-mod-p document that Z mod p is always cylic
of order p-1.
