## Statement

Fermat's little theorem says:

    a^p = a (mod p)

Equivalently,

    a^{p-1} = 1 (mod p)

## Binomial Theorem Proof

I read this on Wolfram. It is inductive. Note the statement is true
for `a = 1` of course.

Use the Binomial Theorem:

    (a + 1)^p = (p choose p) a^p + (p choose p-1) a^{p-1} + ...
                (p choose 1) a + (p choose 0) 1

Note all the coefficients have the form:

     p! / (k! (p-k)!)

For any `k` st `0<k<p`, then necessarily this is divisible by `p`.

So we can say:

   (a + 1)^p = a^p + 1 (mod p)

But here we use the inductive hypothesis, that `a^p = 1 (mod p)`.

So we have

   (a + 1)^p = a + 1 (mod p)

Done!

## Permutations proof

We know that 1a, 2a, 3a, ..., is just a permutation of 1, 2, 3,
... Therefore we know that:

    (p-1)! = 1a * 2a * 3a ... * (p-1)a

Where the right side is permuted somehow. But this is:

    (p-1)! = (p-1)! a**(p-1)

Cancelation says:

    a**(p-1) = 1.

Donezo.

## Combinatorics

Consider necklaces of length p, where there are `a` choices of beads
at each spot. There are a**p necklaces. Of these, a of them are
constant color. Every other necklace of has p equivalent permutations.

That means that (a**p - a) is divisible by p. That means:

    a**p = a.

## Size of subgroup divides size of group

Consider a subgroup `A` consisting of elements `a_i`. You can also
consider the cosets of the subgroup `bA`. Clearly if `b` is already in
`A`, then `bA = A`.

A coset has the same size as the original subgroup. This is because
`b**-1 bA` gives back `A`. This is only possible if there is a
one-to-one correspondence.

Last, no two cosets partially overlap. Consider if: b_0A intersects
b_1A. Then there is are two elements a_0 and a_1 such that:

    a_0 b_0 = a_1 b_1
    b_0 = (a_0 ** -1) a_1 b_1

So take any `b_0 a`. Then we have that

   b_0 a = b_1 a (a_0 ** -1) a_1

This is an element of `b_1 A`, showing that `b_0 A` is a subset of
`b_1 A`. And of course you can go the other direction.

This shows that cosets partition the group into non-overlapping sets
`bA` all of equal size. This shows that the size of `1A` must divide
the size of the group.

## Euler's Totient Theorem

* a^{phi(n)} = 1 (mod n)
* Where `phi(n)` is the number of coprime numbers `<=n`.
  * Note the `<=n`.
* Note that `phi(p) = p-1` for any prime `p`.
  * Note that `p - phi(p)` is the number of not-coprime numbers `<=n`.
* If `n=pq`, where both prime, then totient is equal to
  `(p-1)*(q-1)`. Why?
  * Consider the number of not-coprimes.
  * This is `p, 2p, ..., (q-1)p`.
  * And also `q, 2q, ..., (p-1)q`.
  * And finally: `pq`.
  * Alternatively, `q + p - 1` (because overcounting).
* But note that this is exactly `pq - (p-1)(q-1)`. Expand the terms.
  * This shows that `phi(pq) = (p-1)(q-1)`.
