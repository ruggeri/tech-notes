## Statement

Fermat's little theorem says:

    a^p = a (mod p)

Equivalently,

    a^{p-1} = 1 (mod p)

## Binomial Theorem Proof

I read this on Wolfram. It is inductive. Note the statement is true
for `a = 1` of course.

Use the Binomial Theorem:

    (a + 1)^p = (p choose p) a^p + (p choose p-1) a^{p-1} + ...
                (p choose 1) a + (p choose 0) 1

Note all the coefficients have the form:

     p! / (k! (p-k)!)

For any `k` st `0<k<p`, then necessarily this is divisible by `p`.

So we can say:

   (a + 1)^p = a^p + 1 (mod p)

But here we use the inductive hypothesis, that `a^p = 1 (mod p)`.

So we have

   (a + 1)^p = a + 1 (mod p)

Done!

## Permutations proof

We know that 1a, 2a, 3a, ..., is just a permutation of 1, 2, 3,
... Therefore we know that:

    (p-1)! = 1a * 2a * 3a ... * (p-1)a

Where the right side is permuted somehow. But this is:

    (p-1)! = (p-1)! a**(p-1)

Cancelation says:

    a**(p-1) = 1.

Donezo.

## Combinatorics

Consider necklaces of length p, where there are `a` choices of beads
at each spot. There are a**p necklaces. Of these, a of them are
constant color. Every other necklace of has p equivalent permutations.

That means that (a**p - a) is divisible by p. That means:

    a**p = a.

## Ned's Approach to Fermat's Little Theorem

Consider the sequence `a^i`. This necessarily must enter a cycle. By
our cancelation discussion, we know that `a^i` will never be
zero. Thus we must eventually enter a cycle where repeated
multiplication brings us back to where we started.

Now, does the cycle contain `a`? Of course. For consider if it did
not. Let us assume that we enter the cycle at `b=a^j` (I don't care
about `j`). Then:

    b a^k = b (mod p)

for some `k`, since this is what it means to be a cycle. But then we
know that

    a^k = 1 (mod p)

by our above cancelation argument. In that case we know that `a^{k +
1}` must be `a`, just as we hoped to fined.

## Ned Proof Continued

I have showed that repeated multiplication does eventually bring you
back to `a (mod p)`. But what if the length of that loop is *not* `p`?
Of course it must be at *most* `p`, but could it be less?

In fact, the cycle length need not be exactly `p`. Consider:

    2^i (mod 7) => 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2
    3^i (mod 7) => 3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 3

What do we see here? We se that `a^{p - 1}` is equal to 1 each
time. But we can see that for some `k` which divides `p-1`, we can
have `a^k=1`. This then implies that `a^p = 1`.

So here is what I want to show: the smallest `k` such that `a^k = 1`
must divide `p-1`.

**TODO**

## Euler's Totient Theorem

* a^{phi(n)} = 1 (mod n)
* Where `phi(n)` is the number of coprime numbers `<=n`.
  * Note the `<=n`.
* Note that `phi(p) = p-1` for any prime `p`.
  * Note that `p - phi(p)` is the number of not-coprime numbers `<=n`.
* If `n=pq`, where both prime, then totient is equal to
  `(p-1)*(q-1)`. Why?
  * Consider the number of not-coprimes.
  * This is `p, 2p, ..., (q-1)p`.
  * And also `q, 2q, ..., (p-1)q`.
  * And finally: `pq`.
  * Alternatively, `q + p - 1` (because overcounting).
* But note that this is exactly `pq - (p-1)(q-1)`. Expand the terms.
  * This shows that `phi(pq) = (p-1)(q-1)`.
