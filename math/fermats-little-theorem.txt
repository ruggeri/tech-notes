## Statement

Fermat's little theorem says:

    a^p = a (mod p)

Equivalently,

    a^{p-1} = 1 (mod p)

## Binomial Theorem Proof

I read this on Wolfram. It is inductive. Note the statement is true
for `a = 1` of course.

Use the Binomial Theorem:

    (a + 1)^p = (p choose p) a^p + (p choose p-1) a^{p-1} + ...
                (p choose 1) a + (p choose 0) 1

Note all the coefficients have the form:

     p! / (k! (p-k)!)

For any `k` st `0<k<p`, then necessarily this is divisible by `p`.

So we can say:

   (a + 1)^p = a^p + 1 (mod p)

But here we use the inductive hypothesis, that `a^p = 1 (mod p)`.

So we have

   (a + 1)^p = a + 1 (mod p)

Done!

## Permutations proof

We know that 1a, 2a, 3a, ..., is just a permutation of 1, 2, 3,
... Therefore we know that:

    (p-1)! = 1a * 2a * 3a ... * (p-1)a

Where the right side is permuted somehow. But this is:

    (p-1)! = (p-1)! a**(p-1)

Cancelation says:

    a**(p-1) = 1.

Donezo.

## Combinatorics

Consider necklaces of length p, where there are `a` choices of beads
at each spot. There are a**p necklaces. Of these, a of them are
constant color. Every other necklace of has p equivalent permutations.

That means that (a**p - a) is divisible by p. That means:

    a**p = a.

## From primitive root theorem

See my z-mod-p document. We know any cyclic subgroup of a cyclic
parent group must have order dividing the order of the parent
group. And I show in the z-mod-p document that Z mod p is always cylic
of order p-1.

## Euler's Totient Theorem

* a^{phi(n)} = 1 (mod n)
* Where `phi(n)` is the number of coprime numbers `<=n`.
  * Note the `<=n`.
* Note that `phi(p) = p-1` for any prime `p`.
  * Note that `p - phi(p)` is the number of not-coprime numbers `<=n`.
