Now, $\vu\vut$ can very easily be verified as symmetric. Since $\mA\mAt$
is just the sum of symmetric matrices, then we know this is symmetric as
well.

This can also be proven like so: the transpose of $\mA\mAt$ is
$\mA\mAt$. That shows the projection is symmetric.

\TODO{What is an intuitive reason for symmetry of projections?} What
does symmetry mean? Not all symmetric matrices can be projections,
right?

Most, why is it worth noting that the matrix is symmetric? How can
that connect to other parts of algebra to give a clearer picture?
