\subsection{Geometric Intutition Of \texorpdfstring{$\mL\mU$}{LU} Decomposition}

Geometrically, what we are doing is this. We are saying: I want $\ve_1$
to only impact the first coordinate of $\vb$; I want to eliminate its
effect on the other coordinates. Then we say: good, now I want $\ve_2$
to only involve itself with the second coordinate in the image space.

What is the idea of such a transformation? Well, it is this: to write
a matrix as a pair of matrices, the first of which sends

\begin{nedqn}
  \ve_i
& \mapsto &
  \sum_{j \leq i} \ve_j
\end{nedqn}

\noindent
and the second which sends

\begin{nedqn}
  \ve_i
& \mapsto &
  \sum_{j \geq i} \ve_j
\end{nedqn}
