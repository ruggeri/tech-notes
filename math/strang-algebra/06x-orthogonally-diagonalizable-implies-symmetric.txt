Consider any transformation that is equivalent to a stretching of an
orthogonal basis. Consider the 2d case. Then we have that the basis
must look like:

    (cos \theta, sin \theta)
    # Here I have used orthogonality of the thetas
    (-sin \theta, cos \theta)

So we know that the projection matrix onto the first vector is:

    |cos \theta cos \theta, sin \theta cos \theta|
    |cos \theta sin \theta, sin \theta sin \theta|
    =
    |cos^2 \theta,        , cos \theta sin \theta|
    |cos \theta sin \theta,          sin^2 \theta|

Note that this is a symmetric matrix. Call it A.

The situation flips a bit for the projection onto the orthogonal
vector:

    |-sin \theta -sin \theta, cos \theta -sin \theta|
    |-sin \theta  cos \theta, cos \theta  cos \theta|
    =
    |sin^2 \theta,          -cos \theta sin \theta|
    |-cos \theta sin\theta,           cos^2 \theta|

Call this B.

Therefore, any orthogonal stretching is equal to `alpha A + beta
B`. The sum of two scaled symmetric matrices is still symmetric. Of
course, if alpha = beta = 1 then we get the identity.

Can any symmetric matrix be broken up like this? The answer must be
yes...

For a 2d matrix symmetric matrix, I can do the determinant of A -
lambdaI, solve for lambda, and show that inside the radical can never
be negative. That ensures that there are distinct eigenvectors, except
if there is a homogenous scaling of the space.

However, this doesn't really give me intuition of why symmetric
matrices with more dimensions symmetric would have full rank
eigenspace.

I'll have to move on for today. But progress!
