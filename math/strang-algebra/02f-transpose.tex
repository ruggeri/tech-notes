\subsection{Transposes}

So let's talk about transposes. I say that $\mAt \vx$ maps $\vx$ to its
projection on each of the columns of $\mA$. That's like almost literally
the definition.

Also note:

\begin{nedqn}
  \mA\vx
\eqcol
    \parenstrans{
        \vxt \mAt
    }
\end{nedqn}

This is maybe obvious.

We already showed that for any orthonormal matrix, the inverse is
equal to its transpose. For a matrix with skew, the transpose
$\mAt$ does not properly invert $\vx$.

We say a matrix is \define{symmetric} if it is equal to its own
transpose.

$\mR\mRt$. (Why did I write this here?)

For \define{permutation matrices}, the transpose is also the inverse.
(This is in part because premutation matrices are rotation matrices,
albeit the rotation might have an imaginary component).

\TODO{I have no idea what symmetry means.}
