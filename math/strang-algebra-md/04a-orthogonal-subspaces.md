As mentioned, row space is perpindicular to the nullspace. Likewise,
the nullspace of `A\trans` is perpindicular to the columnspace. We say
that these pairs are "orthogonal complements", in that they each
contain all the vectors perpindicular to the other.

I must have noted this elsewhere, but since the transformation on the
row-space to the columnspace is one-to-one, then the rank of the row
and column spaces are equal.

He mentions, the transformation from the rowspace to the columnspace
is *always* invertible. Basically, if you leave out the nullspace.
